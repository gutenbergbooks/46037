<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>


<p class="pn"><i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i>, which
I published in December 1919, has been reprinted
from time to time without revision or correction.
So much has come to our knowledge since then,
that a revised edition of that book would be out
of place. I have thought it better, therefore, to
leave it unaltered, and to collect together in this
<i>Sequel</i> the corrections and additions which the
flow of events makes necessary, together with my
reflections on the present facts.</p>

<p>But this book is strictly what it represents itself
to be&mdash;a <i>Sequel</i>; I might almost have said an
Appendix. I have nothing very new to say on
the fundamental issues. Some of the Remedies
which I proposed two years ago are now everybodyʼs

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><span class="smcap">The State of Opinion</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">It is the method of modern statesmen to talk as
much folly as the public demand and to practise
no more of it than is compatible with what they
have said, trusting that such folly in action as
must wait on folly in word will soon disclose itself
as such, and furnish an opportunity for slipping
back into wisdom,&mdash;the Montessori system for the
child, the Public. He who contradicts this child
will soon give place to other tutors. Praise, therefore,
the beauty of the flames he wishes to touch,
the music of the breaking toy; even urge him forward;
yet waiting with vigilant care, the wise and
kindly savior of Society, for the right moment to
snatch him back, just singed and now attentive.</p>

<p>I can conceive for this terrifying statesmanship
a plausible defense. Mr. Lloyd George took the
responsibility for a Treaty of Peace, which was
not wise, which was partly impossible, and which
endangered the life of Europe. He may defend
himself by saying that he knew that it was not
wise and was partly impossible and endangered
the life of Europe; but that public passions and
public ignorance play a part in the world of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
he who aspires to lead a democracy must take account;
that the Peace of Versailles was the best
momentary settlement which the demands of the
mob and the characters of the chief actors conjoined
to permit; and for the life of Europe, that
he has spent his skill and strength for two years
in avoiding or moderating the dangers.</p>

<p>Such claims would be partly true and cannot be
brushed away. The private history of the Peace
Conference, as it has been disclosed by French
and American participators, displays Mr. Lloyd
George in a partly favorable light, generally striving
against the excesses of the Treaty and doing
what he could, short of risking a personal defeat.
The public history of the two years which
have followed it exhibit him as protecting Europe
from as many of the evil consequences of his own
Treaty, as it lay in his power to prevent, with a
craft few could have bettered, preserving the
peace, though not the prosperity, of Europe, seldom
expressing the truth, yet often acting under
its influence. He would claim, therefore, that by
devious paths, a faithful servant of the possible,
he was serving Man.</p>

<p>He may judge rightly that this is the best of
which a democracy is capable,&mdash;to be jockeyed,
humbugged, cajoled along the right road. A preference
for truth or for sincerity <i>as a method</i> may
be a prejudice based on some esthetic or personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
standard, inconsistent, in politics, with practical
good.</p>

<p>We cannot yet tell. Even the public learns by
experience. Will the charm work still, when the
stock of statesmenʼs credibility, accumulated before
these times, is getting exhausted?</p>

<p>In any event, private individuals are not under
the same obligation as Cabinet Ministers to sacrifice
veracity to the public weal. It is a permitted
self&ndash;indulgence for a private person to
speak and write freely. Perhaps it may even contribute
one ingredient to the congeries of things
which the wands of statesmen cause to work together,
so marvelously, for our ultimate good.</p>

<p class="p2">For these reasons I do not admit error in having
based <i>The Economic Consequences of the
Peace</i> on a literal interpretation of the Treaty of
Versailles, or in having examined the results of
actually carrying it out. I argued that much of
it was <i>impossible;</i> but I do not agree with many
critics, who held that, for this very reason, it was
also harmless. Inside opinion accepted from the
beginning many of my main conclusions about
the Treaty.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But it was not therefore unimportant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
that outside opinion should accept them also.</p>

<p>For there are, in the present times, two opinions;
not, as in former ages, the true and the false,
but the outside and the inside; the opinion of the
public voiced by the politicians and the newspapers,
and the opinion of the politicians, the journalists
and the civil servants, upstairs and backstairs
and behind&ndash;stairs, expressed in limited circles.
In time of war it became a patriotic duty
that the two opinions should be as different as possible;
and some seem to think it so still.</p>

<p>This is not entirely new. But there has been a
change. Some say that Mr. Gladstone was a
hypocrite; yet if so, he dropped no mask in private
life. The high tragedians, who once ranted
in the Parliaments of the world, continued it at
supper afterwards. But appearances can no
longer be kept up behind the scenes. The paint
of public life, if it is ruddy enough to cross the
flaring footlights of to&ndash;day, cannot be worn in
private,&mdash;which makes a great difference to the
psychology of the actors themselves. The multitude
which lives in the auditorium of the world
needs something larger than life and plainer than
the truth. Sound itself travels too slowly in this
vast theater, and a true word no longer holds
when its broken echoes have reached the furthest
listener.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who live in the limited circles and share
the inside opinion pay both too much and too little
attention to the outside opinion; too much, because,
ready in words and promises to concede
to it everything, they regard open opposition as
absurdly futile; too little, because they believe that
these words and promises are so certainly destined
to change in due season, that it is pedantic, tiresome,
and inappropriate to analyze their literal
meaning and exact consequences. They know all
this nearly as well as the critic, who wastes, in
their view, his time and his emotions in exciting
himself too much over what, on his own showing,
cannot possibly happen. Nevertheless, what is
said before the world is, still, of deeper consequence
than the subterranean breathings and well&ndash;informed
whisperings, knowledge of which allows
inside opinion to feel superior to outside opinion,
even at the moment of bowing to it.</p>

<p>But there is a further complication. In England
(and perhaps elsewhere also), there are <i>two</i>
outside opinions, that which is expressed in the
newspapers and that which the mass of ordinary
men privately suspect to be true. These two degrees
of the outside opinion are much nearer to
one another than they are to the inside, and under
some aspects they are identical; yet there is under
the surface a real difference between the dogmatism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and definiteness of the press and the living,
indefinite belief of the individual man. I
fancy that even in 1919 the average Englishman
never really believed in the indemnity; he took it
always with a grain of salt, with a measure of intellectual
doubt. But it seemed to him that for the
time being there could be little practical harm in
going on the indemnity tack, and also that, in relation
to his feelings at that time, a belief in the
possibility of boundless payments by Germany
was in better sentiment, even if less true, than the
contrary. Thus the recent modification in British
outside opinion is only partly intellectual, and is
due rather to changed conditions; for it is seen
that perseverance with the indemnity does now
involve practical harm, whilst the claims of sentiment
are no longer so decisive. He is therefore
prepared to attend to arguments, of which
he had always been aware out of the corner of
his eye.</p>

<p>Foreign observers are apt to heed too little these
unspoken sensibilities, which the voice of the press
is bound to express ultimately. Inside opinion
gradually affects them by percolating to wider and
wider circles; and they are susceptible in time to
argument, common sense, or self&ndash;interest. It is
the business of the modern politician to be accurately
aware of all three degrees; he must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
enough intellect to understand the inside opinion,
enough sympathy to detect the inner outside opinion,
and enough brass to express the outer outside
opinion.</p>

<p>Whether this account is true or fanciful, there
can be no doubt as to the immense change in public
sentiment over the past two years. The desire
for a quiet life, for reduced commitments, for
comfortable terms with our neighbors is now paramount.
The megalomania of war has passed
away, and every one wishes to conform himself
with the facts. For these reasons the Reparation
Chapter of the Treaty of Versailles is
crumbling. There is little prospect now of the
disastrous consequences of its fulfilment.</p>

<p>I undertake in the following chapters a double
task, beginning with a chronicle of events and a
statement of the present facts, and concluding
with proposals of what we ought to do. I naturally
attach primary importance to the latter.
But it is not only of historical interest to glance
at the recent past. If we look back a little closely
on the two years which have just elapsed (and the
general memory unaided is now so weak that we
know the past little better than the future), we
shall be chiefly struck, I think, by the large element
of injurious make&ndash;believe. My concluding
proposals assume that this element of make&ndash;believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
has ceased to be politically necessary; that
outside opinion is now ready for inside opinion to
disclose, and act upon, its secret convictions; and
that it is no longer an act of futile indiscretion to
speak sensibly in public.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">From the Ratification of the Treaty Of
Versailles to the Second Ultimatum
Of London</span></p>


<p class="pn p1 center">I. <i>The Execution of the Treaty and the Plebiscites</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">The Treaty of Versailles was ratified on January
10, 1920, and except in the plebiscite areas its territorial
provisions came into force on that date.
The Slesvig plebiscite (February and March,
1920) awarded the north to Denmark and the south
to Germany, in each case by a decisive majority.
The East Prussian plebiscite (July, 1920) showed
an overwhelming vote for Germany. The Upper
Silesian plebiscite (March, 1921) yielded a majority
of nearly two to one in favor of Germany
for the province as a whole,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but a majority for
Poland in certain areas of the south and east. On
the basis of this vote, and having regard to the
industrial unity of certain disputed areas, the
principal Allies, with the exception of France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
were of opinion that, apart from the southeastern
districts of Pless and Rybnik which, although they
contain undeveloped coalfields of great importance,
are at present agricultural in character,
nearly the whole of the province should be assigned
to Germany. Owing to the inability of
France to accept this solution, the whole problem
was referred to the League of Nations for final
arbitration. This body bisected the industrial
area in the interests of racial or nationalistic justice;
and introduced at the same time, in the endeavor
to avoid the consequences of this bisection,
complicated economic provisions of doubtful efficiency
in the interests of material prosperity.
They limited these provisions to fifteen years,
trusting perhaps that something will have occurred
to revise their decision before the end of
that time. Broadly speaking, the frontier has been
drawn, entirely irrespective of economic considerations,
so as to include as large as possible a
proportion of German voters on one side of it and
Polish voters on the other (although to achieve
this result it has been thought necessary to assign
two almost purely German towns, Kattowitz
and Königshütte to Poland). From this limited
point of view the work may have been done fairly.
But the Treaty had directed that economic and
geographical considerations should be taken into
account also.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>I do not intend to examine in detail the wisdom
of this decision. It is believed in Germany that
subterranean influence brought to bear by France
contributed to the result. I doubt if this was a
material factor, except that the officials of the
League were naturally anxious, in the interests
of the League itself, to produce a solution which
would not be a fiasco through the members of the
Council of the League failing to agree about it
amongst themselves; which inevitably imported a
certain bias in favor of a solution acceptable to
France. The decision raises, I think, much more
fundamental doubts about this method of settling
international affairs.</p>

<p>Difficulties do not arise in simple cases. The
League of Nations will be called in where there is
a conflict between opposed and incommensurable
claims. A good decision can only result by impartial,
disinterested, very well&ndash;informed and authoritative
persons taking <i>everything</i> into account.
Since International Justice is dealing with
vast organic units and not with a multitude of
small units of which the individual particularities
are best ignored and left to average themselves
out, it cannot be the same thing as the cut&ndash;and&ndash;dried
lawyerʼs justice of the municipal court.
It will be a dangerous practice, therefore, to entrust
the settlement of the ancient conflicts now
inherent in the tangled structure of Europe, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
elderly gentlemen from South America and the
far Asiatic East, who will deem it their duty to
extract a strict legal interpretation from the
available signed documents,&mdash;who will, that is to
say, take account of as <i>few</i> things as possible, in
an excusable search for a simplicity which is not
there. That would only give us more judgments
of Solomon with the assʼs ears, a Solomon with
the bandaged eyes of law, who, when he says “Divide
ye the living child in twain,” means it.</p>

<p>The Wilsonian dogma, which exalts and dignifies
the divisions of race and nationality above the
bonds of trade and culture, and guarantees frontiers
but not happiness, is deeply embedded in the
conception of the League of Nations as at present
constituted. It yields us the paradox that the
first experiment in international government
should exert its influence in the direction of intensifying
nationalism.</p>

<p>These parenthetic reflections have arisen from
the fact that from a certain limited point of view
the Council of the League may be able to advance
a good case in favor of its decision. My criticism
strikes more deeply than would a mere allegation
of partiality.</p>

<p>With the conclusion of the plebiscites the frontiers
of Germany were complete.</p>

<p>In January 1920 Holland was called on to surrender
the Kaiser; and, to the scarcely concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
relief of the Governments concerned, she duly refused
(January 23, 1920). In the same month the
surrender of some thousands of “war criminals”
was claimed, but, in the face of a passionate protest
from Germany, was not insisted on. It was
arranged instead that, in the first instance at
least, only a limited number of cases should be
pursued, not before Allied Courts, as provided by
the Treaty, but before the High Court of Leipzig.
Some such cases have been tried; and now, by
tacit consent, we hear no more about it.</p>

<p>On March 13, 1920, an outbreak by the reactionaries
in Berlin (the Kapp “Putsch”) resulted in
their holding the capital for five days and in the
flight of the Ebert Government to Dresden. The
defeat of this outbreak, largely by means of the
weapon of the general strike (the first success of
which was, it is curious to note, in defense of established
order), was followed by Communist disturbances
in Westphalia and the Ruhr. In dealing
with this second outbreak, the German Government
despatched more troops into the district than
was permissible under the Treaty, with the result
that France seized the opportunity, without
the concurrence of her Allies, of occupying Frankfurt
(April 6, 1920) and Darmstadt, this being the
immediate occasion of the first of the series of
Allied Conferences recorded below&mdash;the Conference
of San Remo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>These events, and also doubts as to the capacity
of the Central German Government to enforce
its authority in Bavaria, led to successive postponements
of the completion of disarmament, due
under the Treaty for March 31, 1920, until its final
enforcement by the London Ultimatum of May 5,
1921.</p>

<p>There remains Reparation, the chief subject of
the chronicle which follows. In the course of
1920 Germany carried out certain specific deliveries
and restitutions prescribed by the Treaty.
A vast quantity of identifiable property, removed
from France and Belgium, was duly restored to
its owners.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The Mercantile Marine was surrendered.
Some dyestuffs were delivered, and a certain
quantity of coal. But Germany paid no cash,
and the real problem of Reparation was still postponed.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>With the Conferences of the spring and summer
of 1920 there began the long series of attempts
to modify the impossibilities of the Treaty and
to mold it into workable form.</p>

1920), <i>Hythe</i> (<i>May</i> 15 <i>and June</i> 19, 1920),
<i>Boulogne</i> (<i>June</i> 21, 22, 1920), <i>Brussels</i> (<i>July</i>
2&ndash;3, 1920), <i>and Spa</i> (<i>July</i> 5&ndash;16, 1920)</p>

<p class="pn">It is difficult to keep distinct the series of a
dozen discussions between the Premiers of the
Allied Powers which occupied the year from April
1920 to April 1921. The result of each Conference
was generally abortive, but the total effect
was cumulative; and by gradual stages the project
of revising the Treaty gained ground in every
quarter. The Conferences furnish an extraordinary
example of Mr. Lloyd Georgeʼs methods. At
each of them he pushed the French as far as he
could, but not as far as he wanted; and then came
home to acclaim the settlement provisionally
reached (and destined to be changed a month
later) as an expression of complete accord between
himself and his French colleague, as a nearly perfect
embodiment of wisdom, and as a settlement
which Germany would be well advised to accept
as final, adding about every third time that, if she
did not, he would support the invasion of her territory.
As time went on, his reputation with the
French was not improved; yet he steadily gained
his object,&mdash;though this may be ascribed not to
the superiority of the method as such, but to facts
being implacably on his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of the series, the Conference of San
Remo (April 19&ndash;26, 1920), was held under the
presidency of the Italian Premier, Signor Nitti,
who did not conceal his desire to revise the Treaty.
M. Millerand stood, of course, for its integrity,
whilst Mr. Lloyd George (according to <i>The Times</i>
of that date) occupied a middle position. Since
it was evident that the French would not then accept
any new formula, Mr. Lloyd George concentrated
his forces on arranging for a discussion
face to face between the Supreme Council and the
German Government, such a meeting, extraordinary
to relate, having never yet been arranged,
neither during the Peace Conference nor afterwards.
Defeated in a proposal to invite German
representatives to San Remo forthwith, he succeeded
in carrying a decision to summon them to
visit Spa in the following month “for the discussion
of the practical application of the Reparation
Clauses.” This was the first step; and for the
rest the Conference contented itself with a Declaration
on German Disarmament. Mr. Lloyd
George had had to concede to M. Millerand that
the integrity of the Treaty should be maintained;
but speaking in the House of Commons on his return
home, he admitted a preference for a not
“too literal” interpretation of it.</p>

<p>In May the Premiers met in privacy at Hythe
to consider their course at Spa. The notion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the sliding scale, which was to play a great part
in the Paris Decisions and the Second Ultimatum
of London, now came definitely on the carpet. A
Committee of Experts was appointed to prepare
for examination a scheme by which Germany
should pay a certain minimum sum each year,
supplemented by further sums in accordance with
her capacity. This opened the way for new
ideas, but no agreement was yet in sight as to
actual figures. Meantime the Spa Conference was
put off for a month.</p>

<p>In the following month the Premiers met again
at Boulogne (June 21, 1920), this meeting being
preceded by an informal week&ndash;end at Hythe (June
19, 1920). It was reported that on this occasion
the Allies got so far as definitely to agree on the
principle of minimum annuities extensible in accordance
with Germanyʼs economic revival. Definite
figures even were mentioned, namely, a period
of thirty&ndash;five years and minimum annuities of
three milliard gold marks. The Spa Conference
was again put off into the next month.</p>

<p>At last the Spa meeting was really due. Again
the Premiers met (Brussels, July 2, 3, 1920) to
consider the course they would adopt. They discussed
many things, especially the proportions in
which the still hypothetical Reparation receipts
were to be divided amongst the claimants.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
no concrete scheme was adopted for Reparation
itself. Meanwhile a memorandum handed in by
the German experts made it plain that no plan
politically possible in France was economically
possible in Germany. “The Note of the German
economic experts,” wrote <i>The Times</i> on July 3,
1920, “is tantamount to a demand for a complete
revision of the Peace Treaty. The Allies have
therefore to consider whether they will call the
Germans sharply to order under the menace of
definite sanctions, or whether they will risk creating
the impression of feebleness by dallying with
German tergiversations.” This was a good idea;
if the Allies could not agree amongst themselves
as to the precise way of altering the Treaty, a
“complete accord” between them could be re&ndash;established
by “calling the Germans sharply to
order” for venturing to suggest that the Treaty
could be altered at all.</p>

<p>At last, on July 5, 1920, the long&ndash;heralded Conference
met. But, although it occupied twelve
days, no time was found for reaching the item on
the agenda which it had been primarily summoned
to discuss&mdash;namely, Reparations. Before this
dangerous topic could be reached urgent engagements
recalled M. Millerand to Paris. One of the
chief subjects actually dealt with, coal, is treated
in Excursus I. at the conclusion of this chapter.
But the chief significance of the meeting lay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the fact that then for the first time the responsible
ministers and experts of Germany and the
Allied States met face to face and used the methods
of public conference and even private intimacy.
The Spa Conference produced no plan;
but it was the outward sign of some progress
under the surface.</p>


<p class="pn center p1">III. <i>The Brussels Conference</i> (<i>December</i> 16&ndash;22,
1920)</p>

<p class="pn p1">Whilst the Spa Conference made no attempt
to discuss the general question of the Reparation
settlement, it was again agreed that the latter
should be tackled at an early date. But time
passed by, and nothing happened. On September
23, 1920, M. Millerand succeeded to the Presidency
of the French Republic, and his place as
Premier was taken by M. Leygues. French official
opinion steadily receded from the concessions,
never fully admitted to the French public, which
Mr. Lloyd George had extracted at Boulogne.
They now preferred to let the machinery of the
Reparation Commission run its appointed course.
At last, however, on November 6, 1920, after much
diplomatic correspondence, it was announced that
once again the French and British Governments
were in “complete accord.” A conference of experts,
nominated by the Reparation Commission,
was to sit with German experts and report; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
a conference of ministers was to meet the German
Government and report; with these two reports
before it the Reparation Commission was
to fix the amount of Germanyʼs liability; and
finally, the heads of the Allied Governments were
to meet and “take decisions.” “Thus,” <i>The
Times</i> recorded, “after long wanderings in the
wilderness we are back once more at the Treaty
of Versailles.” The re&ndash;perusal of old files of
newspapers, which the industrious author has undertaken,
corroborates, if nothing else does, the
words of the Preacher and the dustiness of
fate.</p>

<p>The first stage of this long procedure was in
fact undertaken, and certain permanent officials
of the Allied Governments<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> met German representatives
at Brussels, shortly before Christmas
1920, to ascertain facts and to explore the situation
generally. This was a conference of “experts”
as distinguished from the conferences of
“statesmen” which preceded and followed it.</p>

<p>The work of the Brussels experts was so largely
ignored and overthrown by the meetings of the
statesmen at Paris shortly afterwards, that it is
not now worth while to review it in detail. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
marked, however, a new phase in our relations
with Germany. The officials of the two sides met
in an informal fashion and talked together like
rational beings. They were representative of the
pick of what might be called “international officialdom,”
cynical, humane, intelligent, with a
strong bias towards facts and a realistic treatment.
Both sides believed that progress was being
made towards a solution; mutual respect was fostered;
and a sincere regret was shared at the
early abandonment of reasonable conversations.</p>

<p>The Brussels experts did not feel themselves
free to consider an average payment less than
that contemplated at Boulogne. They recommended
to the Allied Governments, accordingly,
(1) that during the five years from 1921 to 1926
Germany should pay an <i>average</i> annuity of $750,000,000,
but that this average annuity should be
so spread over the five years that less than this
amount would be payable in the first two years
and more in the last two years, the question of the
amount of subsequent payments, after the expiry
of five years, being postponed for the present;</p>

<p>(2)  That a substantial part of this sum should
be paid in the form of deliveries of material and
not of cash;</p>

<p>(3)  That the annual expenses of the Armies of
Occupation should be limited to $60,000,000, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
payment need not be additional to the above annuities
but a first charge on them;</p>

<p>(4) That the Allies should waive their claim on
Germany to build ships for them and should perhaps
relinquish, or postpone, the claim for the delivery
of a certain number of the existing German
vessels;</p>

<p>(5) That Germany on her side should put her
finances and her budget in order and should agree
to the Allies taking control of her customs in the
event of default under the above scheme.</p>


<p class="pn p1 center">IV. <i>The Decisions of Paris</i> (<i>January</i> 24&ndash;30, 1921)</p>

<p class="pn p1">The suggestions of the Brussels experts furnished
no permanent settlement of the question,
but they represented, nevertheless, a great advance
from the ideas of the Treaty. In the
meantime, however, opinion in France was rising
against the concessions contemplated. M.
Leygues, it appeared, would be unable to carry in
the Chamber the scheme discussed at Boulogne.
Prolonged political intrigue ended in the succession
of M. Briand to the Premiership, with the
extreme defenders of the literal integrity of the
Treaty of Versailles, M. Poincaré, M. Tardieu,
and M. Klotz, still in opposition. The projects of
Boulogne and Brussels were thrown into the melting&ndash;pot,
and another conference was summoned to
meet at Paris at the end of January 1921.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at first doubtful whether the proceedings
might not terminate with a breach between the
British and the French points of view. Mr. Lloyd
George was justifiably incensed at having to surrender
most of the ground which had seemed definitely
gained at Boulogne; with these fluctuations
negotiation was a waste of time and progress impossible.
He was also disinclined to demand payments
from Germany which <i>all</i> the experts now
thought impossible. For a few days he was entirely
unaccommodating to the French contentions;
but as the business proceeded he became
aware that M. Briand was a kindred spirit, and
that, whatever nonsense he might talk in public,
he was secretly quite sensible. A breach in the
conversations might mean the fall of Briand and
the entrance to office of the wild men, Poincaré
and Tardieu, who, if their utterances were to be
taken seriously and were not merely a ruse to
obtain office, might very well disturb the peace of
Europe before they could be flung from authority.
Was it not better that Mr. Lloyd George and M.
Briand, both secretly sensible, should remain colleagues
at the expense of a little nonsense in unison
for a short time? This view of the situation
prevailed, and an ultimatum was conveyed to Germany
on the following lines.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The Reparation payments, proposed to Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
by the Paris Conference, were made up of
a determinate part and an indeterminate part.
The former consisted of $500,000,000 per annum
for two years, $750,000,000 for the next three, then
$1,000,000,000 for three more, and $1,250,000,000
for three after that, and, finally, $1,500,000,000
annually for 31 years. The latter (the indeterminate
part) consisted of an annual sum, additional
to the above, equal in value to 12 per cent
of the German exports. The fixed payments under
this scheme added up to a gross total of $56,500,000,000
which was a little less than the gross
total contemplated at Boulogne but, with the export
proportion added, a far greater sum.</p>

<p>The indeterminate element renders impossible
an exact calculation of this burden, and it is no
longer worth while to go into details. But I calculated
at the time, without contradiction, that
these proposals amounted for the normal period
to a demand exceeding $2,000,000,000 per annum,
which is double the highest figure that any competent
person in Great Britain or in the United
States has ever attempted to justify.</p>

<p>The Paris Decisions, however, coming as they
did after the discussions of Boulogne and Brussels,
were not meant seriously, and were simply
another move in the game, to give M. Briand a
breathing space. I wonder if there has ever been
anything quite like it&mdash;best diagnosed perhaps as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
a consequence of the portentous development of
“propaganda.” The monster had escaped from
the control of its authors, and the extraordinary
situation was produced in which the most powerful
statesmen in the world were compelled by
forces, which they could not evade, to meet together
day after day to discuss detailed variations
of what they knew to be impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd George successfully took care, however,
that the bark should have no immediate bite
behind it. The consideration of effective penalties
was postponed, and the Germans were invited
to attend in London in a monthʼs time to convey
their answer by word of mouth.</p>

<p>M. Briand duly secured his triumph in the
Chamber. “Rarely,” <i>The Times</i> reported, “can
M. Briand in all his long career as a speaker and
Parliamentarian have been in better form. The
flaying of M. Tardieu was intensely dramatic, even
if at times almost a little painful for the spectators
as well as for the victim.” M. Tardieu
had overstated his case, and “roundly asserting
that the policy of France during the last year had
been based on the conclusion that the financial
clauses of the Treaty of Versailles could not be
executed, had gained considerable applause by declaring
that this was just the thesis of the pacifist,
Mr. Keynes, and of the German delegate, Count
Brockdorff&ndash;Rantzau,”&mdash;which was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
rather unfair to the Paris Decisions. But by that
date, even in France, to praise the perfections of
the Treaty was to make oneself ridiculous. “I
am an ingenuous man,” said M. Briand as he
mounted the tribune, “and when I received from
M. Tardieu news that he was going to interpellate
me, I permitted myself to feel a little pleased. I
told myself that M. Tardieu was one of the principal
architects of the Treaty of Versailles, and
that as such, though he knew its good qualities, he
would also know its blemishes, and that he would,
therefore, be indulgent to a man who had done
his best in fulfilling his duty of applying it&mdash;<i>mais
voilà</i> (with a gesture)&mdash;I did not stop to remember
that M. Tardieu had already expended all
his stock of indulgence upon his own handiwork.”
The monstrous offspring of propaganda was
slowly dying.</p>

<p class="pn p1 center">V. <i>The First Conference of London</i> (<i>March</i> 1&ndash;7,
1921)</p>

<p class="pn p1">In Germany the Paris proposals were taken
seriously and provoked a considerable outcry.
But Dr. Simons accepted the invitation to London
and his experts got to work at a counter&ndash;proposal.
“I was in agreement,” he said at Stuttgart on
February 13, “with the representatives of Britain
and France at the Brussels Conference. The
Paris Conference shattered that. A catastrophe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
has occurred. German public opinion will never
forget these figures. Now it is impossible to return
to the Seydoux plan put forward at Brussels
(<i>i.e.</i>, a provisional settlement for five years), for
the German people would always see enormous
demands rising before them like a specter....
We shall rather accept unjust dictation than sign
undertakings we are not firmly persuaded the
German people can keep.”</p>

<p>On March 1, 1921, Dr. Simons presented his
counter&ndash;proposal to the Allies assembled in London.
Like the original counter&ndash;proposal of
Brockdorff&ndash;Rantzau at Versailles, it was not
clear&ndash;cut or entirely intelligible; and it was rumored
that the German experts were divided in
opinion amongst themselves. Instead of stating
in plain language what Germany thought she could
perform, Dr. Simons started from the figures of
the Paris Decisions and then proceeded by transparent
and futile juggling to reduce them to a
quite different figure. The process was as follows.
Take the gross total of the fixed annuities
of the Paris scheme (<i>i.e.</i>, apart from the export
proportion), namely $56,500,000,000, and calculate
its present value at <i>8 per cent interest</i>, namely
$12,500,000,000; deduct from this $5,000,000,000 as
the alleged (but certainly not the actual) value
of Germanyʼs deliveries up to date, which leaves
$7,500,000,000. This was the utmost Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
could pay. If the Allies could raise an international
loan of $2,000,000,000, Germany would pay
the interest and sinking fund on this, and in addition
$250,000,000 a year for five years, towards
the discharge of the capital sum remaining over
and above the $2,000,000,000, namely, $5,500,000,000,
which capital sum, however, would not carry
interest pending repayment. At the end of five
years the rate of repayment would be reconsidered.
The whole proposal was contingent on the
retention of Upper Silesia and the removal of all
impediments to German trade.</p>

<p>The actual substance of this proposal was not
unreasonable and probably as good as the Allies
will ultimately secure. But the figures were far
below even those of the Brussels experts, and the
mode of putting it forward naturally provoked
prejudice. It was summarily rejected.</p>

<p>Two days later Mr. Lloyd George read to the
German Delegation a lecture on the guilt of their
country, described their proposals as “an offense
and an exasperation,” and alleged that their taxes
were “ridiculously low compared with Great Britainʼs.”
He then delivered a formal declaration
on behalf of the Allies that Germany was in default
in respect of “the delivery for trial of the
criminals who have offended against the laws of
war, disarmament, and the payment in cash or
kind of $5,000,000,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>”; and concluded with an
ultimatum<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to the effect that unless he heard by
Monday (March 7) “that Germany was either
prepared to accept the Paris Decisions or to submit
proposals which would be in other ways an
equally satisfactory discharge of her obligations
under the Treaty of Versailles (subject to the
concessions made in the Paris proposals),” the
Allies would proceed to (1) the occupation of
Duisberg, Ruhrort, and Düsseldorf on the right
bank of the Rhine, (2) a levy on all payments due
to Germany on German goods sent to Allied countries,
(3) the establishment of a line of Customs
between the occupied area of Germany and the
rest of Germany, and (4) the retention of the
Customs paid on goods entering or leaving the occupied
area.</p>

<p>During the next few days negotiations proceeded,
to no purpose, behind the scenes. At
midnight on March 6, M. Loucheur and Lord
DʼAbernon offered the Germans the alternative of
a fixed payment of $750,000,000 for 30 years and
an export proportion of 30 per cent.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The formal
Conference was resumed on March 7. “A crowd
gathered outside Lancaster House in the morning
and cheered Marshal Foch and Mr. Lloyd George.
Shouts of ‘Make them pay, Lloyd George!ʼ were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
general. The German delegates were regarded
with curiosity. General von Seeckt wore uniform
with a sword. He wore also an eyeglass in the
approved manner of the Prussian officer and bore
himself as the incarnation of Prussian militarism.
Marshal Foch, Field&ndash;Marshal Sir Henry Wilson,
and the other Allied soldiers also wore uniform.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Simons communicated his formal reply.
He would accept the <i>régime</i> of the Paris Decisions
as fixed for the first five years, provided Germany
was helped to pay by means of a loan and retained
Upper Silesia. At the end of five years the
Treaty of Versailles would resume its authority,
the provisions of which he preferred, as he was
entitled to do, to the proposals of Paris. “The
question of war guilt is to be decided neither by
the Treaty, nor by acknowledgment, nor by Sanctions;
only history will be able to decide the question
as to who was responsible for the world war.
We are all of us still too near to the event.” The
Sanctions threatened were, he pointed out, all of
them illegal. Germany could not be technically in
default in respect of Reparation until the Reparation
Commission had made the pronouncements
due from them on May 1. The occupation of further
German territory was not lawful under the
Treaty. The retention of part of the value of
German goods was contrary to undertakings given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
by the British and Belgian Governments. The
erection of a special Customs tariff in the Rhineland
was only permissible under Article 270 of the
Treaty for the protection of the economic interests
of the Rhineland population and not for the
punishment of the whole German people in respect
of unfulfilled Treaty obligations. The arguments
as to the illegality of the Sanctions were
indisputable, and Mr. Lloyd George made no attempt
to answer them. He announced that the
Sanctions would be put into operation immediately.</p>

<p>The rupture of the negotiations was received in
Paris “with a sigh of relief,”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and orders were
telegraphed by Marshal Foch for his troops to
march at 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> next morning.</p>

<p>No new Reparation scheme, therefore, emerged
from the Conference of London. Mr. Lloyd
Georgeʼs acquiescence in the Decisions of Paris
had led him too far. Some measure of personal
annoyance at the demeanor of the German representatives
and the failure of what, in its inception,
may have been intended as bluff, had ended
in his agreeing to an attempt to enforce the Decisions
by the invasion of Germany. The economic
penalties, whether they were legal or not,
were so obviously ineffective for the purpose of
collecting money, that they can hardly have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
intended for that purpose, and were rather designed
to frighten Germany into putting her name
to what she could not, and did not intend to perform,
by threatening a serious step in the direction
of the policy, openly advocated in certain French
quarters, of permanently detaching the Rhine
provinces from the German Commonwealth. The
grave feature of the Conference of London lay
partly in Great Britainʼs lending herself to a furtherance
of this policy, and partly in contempt for
the due form and processes of law.</p>

<p>For it was impossible to defend the legality of
the occupation of the three towns under the
Treaty of Versailles.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Mr. Lloyd George endeavored
to do so in the House of Commons, but at a
later stage of the debate the contention was virtually
abandoned by the Attorney&ndash;General.</p>

<p>The object of the Allies was to compel Germany
to accept the Decisions of Paris. But Germanyʼs
refusal to accept these proposals was within her
rights and not contrary to the Treaty, since they
lay outside the Treaty and included features unauthorized
by the Treaty which Germany was at
liberty either to accept or to reject. It was necessary,
therefore, for the Allies to find some other
pretext. Their effort in this direction was perfunctory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and consisted, as already recorded, in
a vague reference to war criminals, disarmament,
and the payment of 20 milliard gold marks.</p>

<p>The allegation of default in paying the 20 milliard
gold marks was manifestly untenable at that
date (March 7, 1921); for according to the Treaty,
Germany had to pay this sum by May 1, 1921, “in
such instalments and in such manner as the Reparation
Commission may fix,” and in March 1921
the Reparation Commission had not yet demanded
these cash payments.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But assuming
that there had been technical default in respect
of the war criminals and disarmament (and the
original provisions of the Treaty had been so constantly
modified that it was very difficult to say
to what extent this was the case), it was our duty
to state our charges precisely, and, if penalties
were threatened, to make these penalties dependent
on a failure to meet our charges. We were
not entitled to make vague charges, and then
threaten penalties unless Germany agreed to
something which had nothing to do with the
charges. The Ultimatum of March 7 substituted
for the Treaty the intermittent application of
force in exaction of varying demands. For whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Germany was involved in a technical breach
of any one part of the Treaty, the Allies were,
apparently, to consider themselves entitled to
make any changes they saw fit in any other part
of the Treaty.</p>

<p>In any case the invasion of Germany beyond
the Rhine was not a lawful act under the Treaty.
This question became of even greater importance
in the following month, when the French announced
their intention of occupying the Ruhr.
The legal issue is discussed in Excursus II. at the
conclusion of this Chapter.</p>


<p class="pn p1 center">VI. <i>The Second Conference of London</i>
(<i>April</i> 29&ndash;<i>May</i> 5, 1921)</p>

<p class="pn p1">The next two months were stormy. The Sanctions
embittered the situation in Germany without
producing any symptoms of surrender in the
German Government. Towards the end of March
the latter sought the intervention of the United
States and transmitted a new counter&ndash;proposal
through the Government of that country. In addition
to being straightforward and more precise,
this offer was materially better than that of Dr.
Simons in London at the beginning of the month.
The chief provisions<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> were as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>1.  The German liability to be fixed at $12,500,000,000
present value.</p>

<p>2.  As much of this as possible to be raised immediately
by an international loan, issued on attractive
terms, of which the proceeds would be
handed over to the Allies, and the interest and
sinking fund on which Germany would bind herself
to meet.</p>

<p>3.  Germany to pay interest on the balance at 4
per cent for the present.</p>

<p>4.  The sinking fund on the balance to vary with
the rate of Germanyʼs recovery.</p>

<p>5.  Germany, in part discharge of the above, to
take upon herself the actual reconstruction of
the devastated areas on any lines agreeable to the
Allies, and in addition to make deliveries in kind
on commercial lines.</p>

<p>6.  Germany is prepared, “up to her powers of
performance,” to assume the obligations of the
Allies to America.</p>

<p>7.  As an earnest of her good intentions, she
offers $250,000,000 in cash immediately.</p>

<p>If this is compared with Dr. Simonsʼs first offer,
it will be seen that it is at least 50 per cent better,
because there is no longer any talk of deducting
from the total of $12,500,000,000 an alleged (and
in fact imaginary) sum of $5,000,000,000 in respect
of deliveries prior to May 1, 1921. If we
assume an international loan of $1,250,000,000,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
costing 8 per cent for interest and sinking fund,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
the German offer amounted to an immediate payment
of $550,000,000 per annum, with a possibility
of an increase later in proportion to the rate
of Germanyʼs economic recovery.</p>

<p>The United States Government, having first ascertained
privately that this offer would not be
acceptable to the Allies, refrained from its formal
transmission.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> On this account, and also because
it was overshadowed shortly afterwards by the
Second Conference of London, this very straightforward
proposal has never received the attention
it deserves. It was carefully and precisely
drawn up, and probably represented the full
maximum that Germany could have performed, if
not more.</p>

<p>But the offer, as I have said, made very little
impression; it was largely ignored in the press,
and scarcely commented on anywhere. For in the
two months which elapsed between the First and
Second Conferences of London there were two
events of great importance, which modified the
situation materially.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The first of these was the result of the Silesian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
plebiscite held in March 1921. The earlier German
Reparation offers had all been contingent on
her retention of Upper Silesia; and this condition
was one which, in advance of the plebiscite, the
Allies were unable to accept. But it now appeared
that Germany was in fact entitled to most
of the country, and, possibly, to the greater part
of the industrial area. But this result also
brought to a head the acute divergence between
the policy of France and the policy of the other
Allies towards this question.</p>

<p>The second event was the decision of the Reparation
Commission, communicated to Germany on
April 27, 1921, as to her aggregate liabilities under
the Treaty. Allied Finance Ministers had
foreshadowed 300 milliard gold marks; at the time
of the Decisions of Paris, responsible opinion expected
160&ndash;200 milliards;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and the author of <i>The
Economic Consequences of the Peace</i> had suffered
widespread calumny for fixing on the figure of 137
milliards,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> as being the nearest estimate he could
make. The public, and the Government also, were,
therefore, taken by surprise when the Reparation
Commission announced that they unanimously assessed
the figure at 132 milliards (<i>i.e.</i>, $33,000,000,000).<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
It now turned out that the Decisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of Paris, which had been represented as a material
amelioration of the Treaty which Germany
was ungrateful not to accept, were no such thing;
and that Germany was at that moment suffering
from an invasion of her territory for a refusal to
subscribe to terms which were severer in some respects
than the Treaty itself. I shall examine the
decision of the Reparation Commission in detail
in Chapter IV. It put the question on a new basis
and the Decisions of London could hardly have
been possible otherwise.</p>

<p>The decision of the Reparation Commission and
the arrival of the date, May 1, 1921, fixed in the
Treaty for the promulgation of a definite Reparation
scheme, provided a sufficient ground for
reopening the whole question. Germany had refused
the Decisions of Paris; the Sanctions had
failed to move her; the régime of the Treaty was
therefore reinstated; and under the Treaty it was
for the Reparation Commission to propose a
scheme.</p>

<p>In these circumstances the Allies met once more
in London in the closing days of April 1921. The
scheme there concerted was really the work of the
Supreme Council, but the forms of the Treaty
were preserved, and the Reparation Commission
were summoned from Paris to adopt and promulgate
as their own the decree of the Supreme Council.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>The Conference met in circumstances of great
tension. M. Briand had found it necessary to
placate his Chamber by announcing that he intended
to occupy the Ruhr on May 1. The policy
of violence and illegality, which began with the
Conference of Paris, had always included hitherto
just a sufficient ingredient of make&ndash;believe to prevent
its being as dangerous as it pretended to the
peace and prosperity of Europe. But a point had
now been reached when something definite,
whether good or bad, seemed bound to happen;
and there was every reason for anxiety. Mr.
Lloyd George and M. Briand had walked hand&ndash;in&ndash;hand
to the edge of a precipice; Mr. Lloyd
George had looked over the edge; and M. Briand
had praised the beauties of the prospect below and
the exhilarating sensations of a descent. Mr.
Lloyd George, having indulged to the full his habitual
morbid taste for looking over, would certainly
end in drawing back, explaining at the same
time how much he sympathized with M. Briandʼs
standpoint. But would M. Briand?</p>

<p>In this atmosphere the Conference met, and,
considering all the circumstances, including the
past commitments of the principals, the result was,
on the whole, a victory for good sense, not least
because the Allies there decided to return to the
pathway of legality within the ambit of the Treaty.
The new proposals, concerted at this Conference,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
were, whether they were practicable or not in execution,
a lawful development of the Treaty, and
in this respect sharply distinguished from the Decisions
of Paris in the January preceding. However
bad the Treaty might be, the London scheme
provided a way of escape from a policy worse
even than that of the Treaty,&mdash;acts, that is, of
arbitrary lawlessness based on the mere possession
of superior force.</p>

<p>In one respect the Second Ultimatum of London
was lawless; for it included an illegal threat
to occupy the Ruhr Valley if Germany refused its
terms. But this was for the sake of M. Briand,
whose minimum requirement was that he should
at least be able to go home in a position to use,
for conversational purposes, the charms of the
precipice from which he was hurrying away. And
the Ultimatum made no demand on Germany to
which she was not already committed by her signature
to the Treaty.</p>

<p>For this reason the German Government was
right, in my judgment, to accept the Ultimatum
unqualified, even though it still included demands
impossible of fulfilment. For good or ill Germany
had signed the Treaty. The new scheme
added nothing to the Treatyʼs burdens, and, although
a reasonable permanent settlement was
left where it was before,&mdash;in the future,&mdash;in some
respects it abated them. Its ratification, in May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
1921, was in conformity with the Treaty, and
merely carried into effect what Germany had had
reason to anticipate for two years past. It did
not call on her to do immediately&mdash;that is to say,
in the course of the next six months&mdash;anything incapable
of performance. It wiped out the impossible
liability under which she lay of paying
forthwith a balance of $3,000,000,000 due under
the Treaty on May 1. And, above all, it obviated
the occupation of the Ruhr and preserved the
peace of Europe.</p>

<p>There were those in Germany who held that it
must be wrong that Germany should under threats
profess insincerely what she could not perform.
But the submissive acceptance by Germany of a
lawful notice under a Treaty she had already
signed committed her to no such profession, and
involved no recantation of her recent communication
through the President of the United States
as to what would eventually prove in her sincere
belief to be the limits of practicable performance.</p>

<p>In the existence of such sentiments, however,
Germanyʼs chief difficulty lay. It has not been
understood in England or in America how deep
a wound has been inflicted on Germanyʼs self&ndash;respect
by compelling her, not merely to perform
acts, but to subscribe to beliefs which she did not
in fact accept. It is not usual in civilized countries
to use force to compel wrongdoers to confess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
even when we are convinced of their guilt;
it is still more barbarous to use force, after the
fashion of inquisitors, to compel adherence to an
article of belief because we ourselves believe it.
Yet towards Germany the Allies had appeared to
adopt this base and injurious practice, and had enforced
on this people at the point of the bayonet
the final humiliation of reciting, through the
mouths of their representatives, what they believed
to be untrue.</p>

<p>But in the Second Ultimatum of London the
Allies were no longer in this fanatical mood, and
no such requirement was intended. I hoped,
therefore, at the time that Germany would accept
the notification of the Allies and do her best to
obey it, trusting that the whole world is not unreasonable
and unjust, whatever the newspapers
may say; that Time is a healer and an illuminator;
and that we had still to wait a little before
Europe and the United States could accomplish
in wisdom and mercy the economic settlement of
the war.</p>

<h3 class="p2">EXCURSUS I</h3>

<p class="pn center">COAL</p>

<p class="pn p1">The question of coal has always considerable
importance for Reparation, both because (in spite
of the exaggerations of the Treaty) it is a form
in which Germany can make important payments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and also because of the reaction of coal deliveries
on Germanyʼs internal economy. Up to the middle
of 1921 Germanyʼs payments for Reparation
were almost entirely in the form of coal. And
coal was the main topic of the Spa Conference,
where for the first time the Governments of the
Allies and of Germany met face to face.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the Treaty Germany was to
deliver 3,400,000 tons of coal per month. For
reasons explained in detail in <i>The Economic Consequences
of the Peace</i> (pp. 74&ndash;89) this total was
a figure of rhetoric and not capable of realization.
Accordingly for the first quarter of 1920
the Reparation Commission reduced their demand
to 1,660,000 tons per month, and in the second
quarter to 1,500,000 tons per month; whilst in the
second quarter Germany actually delivered at the
rate of 770,000 tons per month. This last figure
was unduly low, and by the latter date coal was
in short supply throughout the world and very
dear. The main object of the Spa Coal Agreement
was, therefore, to secure for France an increased
supply of German coal.</p>

<p>The Conference was successful in obtaining
coal, but on terms not unfavorable to Germany.
After much bargaining the deliveries were fixed
at 2,000,000 tons a month for six months from
August 1920. But the German representatives
succeeded in persuading the Allies that they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
not deliver this amount unless their miners were
better fed and that this meant foreign credit.
The Allies agreed, therefore, to <i>pay</i> Germany
something substantial for this coal, the sums thus
received to be utilized in purchasing from abroad
additional food for the miners. In form, the
greater part of the sum thus paid was a loan;
but, since it was set off as a prior charge against
the value of Reparation deliveries (<i>e.g.</i>, the
ships), it really amounted to paying back to Germany
the value of a part of these deliveries. Germanyʼs
total cash receipts<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> under these arrangements
actually came to about 360,000,000 gold
marks,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> which worked out at about 40s. per ton
averaged over the whole of the deliveries. As at
this time the German internal price was from 25s.
to 30s. per ton, the German Government received
in foreign currency substantially more than they
had to pay for the coal to the home producers.
The high figure of 2,000,000 tons per month involved
short supplies to German transport and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
industry. But the money was badly wanted, and
was of the utmost assistance in paying for the
German food program (and also in meeting German
liabilities in respect of pre&ndash;war debts) during
the autumn and winter of 1920.</p>

<p>This is a convenient point at which to record
the subsequent history of the coal deliveries. During
the next six months Germany very nearly fulfilled
the Spa Agreement, her deliveries towards
the 2,000,000 tons per month being 2,055,227 tons
in August, 2,008,470 tons in September, 2,288,049
tons in October, 1,912,696 tons in November,
1,791,828 tons in December, and 1,678,675 tons in
January 1921. At the end of January 1921 the
Spa Agreement lapsed, and since that time Germany
has had to continue her coal deliveries without
any payment or advance of cash in return for
them. To make up for the accumulated deficit
under the Spa Agreement, the Reparation Commission
called for 2,200,000 tons per month in
February and March, and continued to demand
this figure in subsequent months. Like so much
else, however, this demand was only on paper.
Germany was not able to fulfil it, her actual deliveries
during the next six months amounting to
1,885,051 tons in February 1921, 1,419,654 tons in
March, 1,510,332 tons in April, 1,549,768 tons in
May, 1,453,761 tons in June, and 1,399,132 tons in
July. And the Reparation Commission, not really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
wanting the coal, tacitly acquiesced in these quantities.
During the first half of 1921 there was, in
fact, a remarkable reversal of the situation six
months earlier. In spite of the British Coal
Strike, France and Belgium, having replenished
their stocks and suffering from a depression in the
iron and steel trades, were in risk of being glutted
with coal. If Germany had complied with the full
demands of the Reparation Commission the recipients
would not have known what to do with the
deliveries. Even as it was, some of the coal received
was sold to exporters, and the coal miners
of France and Belgium were in danger of short
employment.</p>

<p>The statistics of the aggregate German output
of pit coal are now as follows, exclusive of Alsace&ndash;Lorraine,

<p>The production of rough lignite (I will not
risk controversy by attempting to convert this
into its pit&ndash;coal equivalent) rose from 87.1 million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
tons in 1913 to 93.8 in 1919, 111.6 in 1920,
and 90.8 in the first three&ndash;quarters of 1921.</p>

<p>The Spa Agreement supplied a temporary palliative
of the anomalous conditions governing the
<i>price</i> at which these coal deliveries are credited to
Germany. But with the termination of this
Agreement they again require attention. Under
the Treaty Germany is credited in the case of coal
delivered <i>overland</i> with “the German pithead
price to German nationals” plus the freight to
the frontier; and in the case of coal delivered <i>by
sea</i> with the export price; provided in each case
this price is not in excess of the British export
price. Now for various internal reasons the German
Government have thought fit to maintain the
pithead price to German nationals far below the
world price, with the result that she gets credited
with much less than its real value for her deliveries
of Reparation coal. During the year ending
June 1921 the average legal maximum price
of the different kinds of coal was about 270 marks
a ton, inclusive of a tax of 20 per cent on the
price,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> which at the exchange then prevailing was
about 20s., <i>i.e.</i>, between a third and a half of the
British price at that date. The fall in the mark
exchange in the autumn of 1921 increased the discrepancy.
For although the price of German coal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
was substantially increased in terms of paper
marks, and although the price of British coal had
fallen sharply, the movements of exchange so out&ndash;distanced
the other factors, that in November
1921 the price of British coal worked out at about
three and half times the price of the best bituminous
coal from the Ruhr. Thus not only were the
German iron&ndash;masters placed in an advantageous
position for competing with British producers, but
the Belgian and French industries also benefited
artificially through the receipt by their Governments
of very low&ndash;priced coal.</p>

<p>The German Government is in rather a dilemma
in this matter. An increase in the coal tax is one
of the most obvious sources for an increased revenue,
and such a tax would be, from the standpoint
of the exchequer, twice blessed, since it would increase
correspondingly the Reparation credits.
But on the other hand, such a proposal unites two
groups against them, the industrialists, who want
cheap coal for industry and the Socialists who
want cheap coal for the domestic stove. From the
revenue standpoint the tax would probably stand
an increase from 20 per cent to 60 per cent; but
from the political standpoint an increase from 20
per cent to 30 per cent is the highest contemplated
at present, with a differential price in favor of domestic
consumers.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>I take this opportunity of making a few corrections
or amplifications of the passages in <i>The
Economic Consequences of the Peace</i> which deal
with coal.</p>

<p>1. The fate of Upper Silesia is highly relevant
to some of the conclusions about coal in Chapter
IV of <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i>
(pp. 77&ndash;84). I there stated that “German authorities
claim, not without contradiction, that to
judge from the votes cast at elections, one&ndash;third of
the population would elect in the Polish interest,
and two&ndash;thirds in the German,” which forecast
turned out to be in almost exact accordance with
the facts. I also urged that, unless the plebiscite
went in a way which I did not expect, the industrial
districts ought to be assigned to Germany.
But I felt no confidence, having regard to the policy
of France, that this would be done; and I allowed,
therefore, in my figures for the possibility
that Germany would lose this area.</p>

<p>The actual decision of the Allies, acting on the
advice of the Council of the League of Nations to
whom the matter had been referred, which we have
discussed briefly above (pp. 12&ndash;14), divides the
industrial triangle between the two claimants to
it. According to an estimate of the Prussian Ministry
of Trade 86 per cent of the total coal deposits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of Upper Silesia fall to Poland, leaving 14 per
cent to Germany. Germany retains a somewhat
larger proportion of pits in actual operation, 64
per cent of the current production of coal falling
to Poland and 36 per cent to Germany.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The figure of 100,000,000 tons, given in <i>The Economic
Consequences of the Peace</i> for the <i>net</i> German
production (<i>i.e.</i>, deducting consumption at
the mines themselves) in the near future <i>excluding</i>
Upper Silesia, should, therefore, be replaced
by the figure of (say) 115,000,000 tons, <i>including</i>
such part of Upper Silesia as Germany is now to
retain.</p>

<p>2. I beg leave to correct a misleading passage
in a footnote to p. 79 of <i>The Economic Consequences
of the Peace</i>. I there spoke of “Polandʼs
pre&ndash;war annual demand” for coal, where I should
have said “pre&ndash;war Polandʼs pre&ndash;war annual demand.”
The mistake was not material, as I allowed
for Germanyʼs diminished requirements for
coal, due to loss of territory, in the body of the
text. But I confess that the footnote, as published,
might be deemed misleading. At the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
time it is, I think, a tribute to the general accuracy
of <i>The Economic Consequences</i> that partizan
critics should have fastened so greedily on
the omission of the word “pre&ndash;war” before the
word “Poland” in the footnote in question. Quite
a considerable literature has grown up round it.
The Polish Diet devoted January 20, 1921, to the
discussion and patriotic analysis of this footnote,
and concluded with a Resolution ordering the
chief speech of the occasion (that of Deputy A.
Wierzlicki) to be published throughout the world
in several languages at the expense of the State.
I apologize for any depreciation in the Polish
mark for which I may have been so inadvertently
responsible. Mr. Wierzlicki begins: “A book appeared
by Keynes ... the author of a well&ndash;known
work on India, that pearl of the English crown,
that land which is a beloved subject of study to
the English. Through such studies a man may
win himself name and fame,”&mdash;which was certainly
a little unscrupulous of me. And he concludes:
“But England too must believe in facts!
And if Keynes, whose book is impregnated with
a humanitarian spirit and with understanding of
the necessity to get up beyond selfish interests, if
Keynes is convinced by actual data that he has
done a wrong, that he has wrought confusion in
the ideas of statesmen and politicians as regards
Upper Silesia, then he too will see with his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and must become the friend of Poland, of Poland
as an active factor in the development of the natural
wealth of Silesia.” I owe it to so generous
and eloquent a critic to quote the corrected figures,
which are as follows: the Polish lands, united
by the Peace Treaty into the new Polish State,
consumed in 1913 19,445,000 tons of coal, of which
8,989,000 tons were produced within that area and
7,370,000 tons were imported from Upper Silesia
(the total production of Upper Silesia in that year
being 43,800,000 tons).<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The Silesian Plebiscite
has been preceded and followed by a mass of
propagandist literature on both sides. For the
economic questions involved see, particularly, on
the Polish side: Wierzlicki, <i>The Truth about
Upper Silesia</i>; Olszewski, <i>Upper Silesia, Her Influence
on the Solvability and on the Economic
Life of Germany</i>, and <i>The Economic Value of
Upper Silesia for Poland and Germany respectively</i>;
and on the German side: Sidney Osborne,
<i>The Upper Silesian Question and Germanyʼs Coal
Problem, The Problem of Upper Silesia</i> (papers
by various authors, not all on the German side,
with excellent maps, edited by Sidney Osborne),
various pamphlets by Professor Schulz&ndash;Gavernitz,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>and documents circulated by the Breslau Chamber
of Commerce.</p>

<p>3. My observations on Germanyʼs capacity to
deliver reparation coal have been criticized in
some quarters<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> on the ground that I made insufficient
allowance for the compensation which is
available to her by the more intensive exploitation
of her deposits of lignite or brown coal. This
criticism is scarcely fair, because I was the first
in popular controversy to call attention to the factor
of lignite, and because I was careful from the
outset to disclaim expert knowledge of the subject.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
I still find it difficult, in the face of conflicting
expert opinions, to know how much importance
to attach to this material. Since the Armistice
there has been a substantial increase in output,
which was 36 per cent higher in the first half of
1921 than in 1913.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In view of the acute shortage
of coal this output must have been of material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
assistance towards meeting the situation. The
deposits are near the surface, and no great amount
of capital or machinery is needed for its production.
But lignite briquette is a substitute for coal
for certain purposes only, and the evidence is conflicting
as to whether any further material expansion
is economically practicable.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The process of briquetting the rough lignite is
probably a wasteful one, and it is doubtful whether
it would be worth while to set up <i>new</i> plant with
a view to production on a larger scale. Some
authorities hold that the real future of lignite and
its value as an element in the future wealth of
Germany lie in improved methods of <i>distillation</i>
(the chief obstacle to which, as also to other uses,
lies in its high water content), by which the various
oils, ammonia and benzine, latent in it can be
released for commercial uses.</p>

<p>It is certainly the case that the future possibilities
of lignite should not be overlooked. But
there is a tendency at present, just as was the case
with potash some little time ago, to exaggerate its
importance greatly as a decisive factor in the
wealth&ndash;producing capacity of Germany.</p>

<h3 class="p2">EXCURSUS II</h3>

<p class="pn center">THE LEGALITY OF OCCUPYING GERMANY EAST OF THE
RHINE</p>

<p class="pn p1">The years 1920 and 1921 have been filled with
excursions and with threats of excursions by the
French Army into Germany east of the Rhine.
In March 1920 France, without the approval of
her Allies, occupied Frankfort and Darmstadt.
In July 1920 a threat to invade Germany by the
Allies as a whole was successful in enforcing the
Spa Agreement. In March 1921 a similar threat
was unsuccessful in securing assent to the Paris
Decisions, and Duisberg, Ruhrort, and Düsseldorf
were occupied accordingly. In spite of the objections
of her Allies France continued this occupation
when, by the acceptance of the second Ultimatum
of London, the original occasion for it had
disappeared, on the ground that so long as the
Upper Silesian question was unsettled, it was in
the opinion of Marshal Foch just as well to retain
this hold.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In April 1921 the French Government
announced their intention of occupying the Ruhr,
though they were prevented from carrying this
out by the pressure of the other Allies. In May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
1921 the Second Ultimatum of London was successfully
enforced by a threat to occupy the Ruhr
Valley. Thus, within the space of little more than
a year the invasion of Germany, beyond the Rhine,
was threatened five times and actually carried out
twice.</p>

<p>We are supposed to be at peace with Germany,
and the invasion of a country in time of peace is
an irregular act, even when the invaded country is
not in a position to resist. We are also bound by
our adhesion to the League of Nations to avoid
such action. It is, however, the contention of
France, and apparently, from time to time, that of
the British Government also, that these acts are
in some way permissible under the Treaty of Versailles,
whenever Germany is in technical default
in regard to any part of the Treaty, that is to say,
since some parts of the Treaty are incapable of
literal fulfilment, at any time. In particular the
French Government maintained in April 1921 that
so long as Germany possessed any tangible assets
capable of being handed over, she was in voluntary
default in respect of Reparation, and that if
she was in voluntary default any Ally was entitled
to invade and pillage her territory without being
guilty of an act of war. In the previous month
the Allies as a whole had argued that default under
Chapters of the Treaty, other than the Reparation
Chapter, also justified invasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the respect shown for legality is now
very small, the legal position under the Treaty
deserves nevertheless an exact examination.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Versailles expressly provides for
breaches by Germany of the <i>Reparation</i> Chapter.
It contains no special provision for breaches of
other Chapters, and such breaches are, therefore,
in exactly the same position as breaches of any
other Treaty. Accordingly, I will discuss separately
default in respect of Reparation, and other
defaults.</p>

<p>Sections 17 and 18 of the Reparation Chapter,
Annex II. run as follows:</p>

<p>“(17) In case of default by Germany in the
performance of any obligation under this part of
the present Treaty, the Commission will forthwith
give notice of such default to each of the interested
Powers, and will make such recommendations
as to the action to be taken in consequence of
such default as it may think necessary.</p>

<p>“(18) The measures which the Allied and Associated
Powers shall have the right to take in
case of voluntary default by Germany, and which
Germany agrees not to regard as acts of war, may
include economic and financial prohibitions and reprisals,
and in general such other measures as the
respective Governments may determine to be necessary
in the circumstances.”</p>

<p>There is also a provision in Article 430 of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Treaty, by which any part of the occupied area
which has been evacuated may be reoccupied if
Germany fails to observe her obligations with regard
to Reparation.</p>

<p>The French Government base their contention
on the words “and in general such other measures”
in § 18, arguing that this gives them an entirely
free hand. The sentence taken as a whole,
however, supports, on the principle of <i>ejusdem
generis</i>, the interpretation that the other measures
contemplated are of the nature of economic and
financial reprisals. This view is confirmed by the
fact that the rest of the Treaty narrowly limits
the rights of occupying German territory, which,
as M. Tardieuʼs book shows, was the subject of
an acute difference of opinion between France and
her Associates at the Peace Conference. There
is <i>no</i> provision for occupying territory on the
<i>right</i> bank of the Rhine; and the only provision
for occupation in the event of default is that contained
in Article 430. This Article, which provides
for <i>reoccupation</i> of the <i>left</i> bank in the event
of default, would have been entirely pointless and
otiose if the French view were correct. Indeed
the theory, that at any time during the next thirty
years any Ally can invade any part of Germany
on the ground that Germany has not fulfilled every
letter of the Treaty, is on the face of it unreasonable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>In any case, however, §§ 17, 18 of Annex II. of
the Reparation Chapter only operate after a specific
procedure has been set on foot by the Reparation
Commission. It is the duty of the Reparation
Commission to give notice of the default to
each of the interested Powers, including presumably
the United States, and to recommend action.
If the default is voluntary&mdash;there is no provision
as to who is to decide this&mdash;then the paragraphs
in question become operative. There is no warrant
here for isolated action by a single Ally.
And indeed the Reparation Commission have
never so far put this procedure in operation.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, Germany is alleged to be
in default under some other Chapter of the
Treaty, then the Allies have no recourse except
to the League of Nations; and they are bound to
bring into operation Article 17 of the Covenant,
which provides for the case of a dispute between
a member of the League and a non&ndash;member. That
is to say, apart from procedure by the Reparation
Commission as set forth above, breaches or alleged
breaches of this Treaty are in precisely the
same position as breaches of any other treaty between
two Powers which are at peace.</p>

<p>According to Article 17, in the event of a dispute
between a member of the League and a State
which is not a member of the League, the latter
“shall be invited to accept the obligations of membership<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
in the League for the purposes of such
dispute, upon such conditions as the Council may
deem just. If such invitation is accepted, the
provisions of Articles 12 to 16 inclusive shall be
applied, with such modifications as may be deemed
necessary by the Council. Upon such invitation
being given, the Council shall immediately institute
an inquiry into the circumstances of the dispute,
and recommend such action as may seem
best and most effectual in the circumstances.”</p>

<p>Articles 12 to 16 provide, amongst other things,
for arbitration in any case of “disputes as to
the interpretation of a Treaty; as to any question
of international law; as to the existence of
any fact which, if established, would constitute
a breach of any international obligation; or as to
the extent and nature of the reparation to be made
for any such breach.”</p>

<p>The Allies as signatories of the Treaty and of
the Covenant are therefore absolutely precluded
in the event of a breach or alleged breach by Germany
of the Treaty, from proceeding except
under the power given to the Reparation Commission
as stated above, or under Article 17 of
the Covenant. Any other act on their part is illegal.</p>

<p>In any case it is <i>obligatory</i> on the Council of the
League, under Article 17, to invite Germany, in
the event of a dispute between Germany and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Allies, to accept the obligations of membership
in the League for the purposes of such dispute,
and to institute immediately an inquiry into the
circumstances of the dispute.</p>

<p>In my opinion the protest addressed by the German
Government to the Council of the League of
Nations in March 1921 was correctly argued.
But, as with the inclusion of pensions in the Reparation
Bill, we reserve the whole stock of our indignation
over illegality between nations for the
occasions when it is the fault of others. I am
told that to object to this is to overlook “the human
element” and is therefore both wrong and
foolish.</p>

the loss of coal can be made good by the extended use of lignite
or by economies in its present employment; but some authorities

rate of about 120,000,000 tons per annum. At that time the legal
maximum price was 60 paper marks per ton (<i>i.e.</i>, 5s. or less); so

was increased much more than in proportion, namely from 59,000
in 1913 to 171,000 in the first half of 1921. As a result, the cost
of production of lignite rose much faster than that of coal. Also
since its calorific value is much less than that of coal per unit of
weight (even when it is briquetted), it can only compete with
coal, unless it is assisted by preferential freight rates, within a
limited area in the neighborhood of the mines.</p></div>

definitive scheme under the Treaty according to
which Germany for the next two generations is
to discharge her liabilities.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It will not endure.
But it is the <i>fait accompli</i> of the hour, and, therefore,
deserves examination.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The settlement falls into three parts comprising
(1) provisions for the delivery of Bonds; (2)
provisions for setting up in Berlin an Allied Committee
of Guarantees; (3) provisions for actual
payment in cash and kind.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Delivery of Bonds.</i>&mdash;These provisions
are the latest variant of similar provisions in the
Treaty itself. Allied Finance Ministers have encouraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
themselves (or their constituents) with
the hope that some part of the capital sum of
Germanyʼs liabilities might be anticipated by the
sale to private investors of Bonds secured on future
Reparation payments. For this purpose it
was necessary that Germany should deliver negotiable
Bonds. These Bonds do not constitute any
<i>additional</i> burden on Germany. They are simply
documents constituting a title to the sums which,
under other clauses, Germany is to pay over annually
to the Reparation Commission.</p>

<p>The advantages to the Allies of marketing such
Bonds are obvious. If they could get rid of the
Bonds they would have thrown the risk of Germanyʼs
default on to others; they would have
interested a great number of people all over the
world in Germanyʼs not defaulting; and they
would have secured the actual cash which the exigencies
of their Budgets demand. But the hope
is illusory. When at last a real settlement is
made, it may be practicable for the German Government
to float an international loan of moderate
amount, well within the worldʼs estimate of
their minimum capacity of payment. But, though
there are foolish investors in the world, it would
be sanguine to believe that there are so many of
such folly as to swallow at this moment on these
lines a loan of vast dimensions. It costs France
at the present time somewhere about 10 per cent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to float a loan of modest dimensions on the New
York market. As the proposed German Bonds
will carry 5 per cent interest and 1 per cent sinking
fund, it would be necessary to reduce their
price to 57 before they would yield 10 per cent
including redemption. It would be very optimistic,
therefore, to expect to market them at above
half their par value. Even so, the world is not
likely to invest in them any large proportion of
its current savings, so that the whole amount even
of the A Bonds, specified below, could not be marketed
at this price. Moreover, in so far as the
service of the Bonds marketed is within the <i>minimum</i>
expectation of Germanyʼs capacity to pay
(as it would have to be), the financial effect on
the Ally which markets the Bonds is nearly the
same as though they were to borrow themselves at
the rate in question. Except, therefore, in the
case of those Allies whose credit is inferior to
Germanyʼs, the advantage compared with borrowing
on their own credit would not be very material.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The details relating to the Bonds are not likely,
therefore, to be operative, and need not be taken
very seriously. They are really a relic of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
pretenses of the Peace Conference days. Briefly,
the arrangements are as follows:</p>

<p>Germany must deliver 12 milliards of gold
marks ($3,000,000,000) in A Bonds, 38 milliards
($9,500,000,000) in B Bonds, and the balance of
her liabilities, provisionally estimated at 82 milliards
($20,500,000,000), in C Bonds. All the
Bonds carry 5 per cent interest and 1 per cent
cumulative sinking fund. The services of the series
A, B, and C constitute respectively a first,
second, and third charge on the available funds.
The A Bonds are issued to the Reparation Commission
as from May 1, 1921, and the B Bonds as
from November 1, 1921, but the C Bonds shall not
be issued (and shall not carry interest in the meantime)
except as and when the Reparation Commission
is of the opinion that the payments which
Germany is making under the new settlement are
adequate to provide their service.</p>

<p>It may be noticed that the service of the A Bonds
will cost $180,000,000 per annum, a sum well within
Germanyʼs capacity, and the service of the B
Bonds will cost $570,000,000 per annum, making
$750,000,000 altogether, a sum in excess of my
own expectations of what is practicable, but not
in excess of the figure at which some independent
experts, whose opinion deserves respect, have estimated
Germanyʼs probable capacity to pay. It
may also be noticed that the aggregate face value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of the A and B Bonds ($12,500,000,000) corresponds
to the figure at which the German Government
have agreed (in their counter&ndash;proposal
transmitted to the United States) that their aggregate
liability might be assessed. It is probable
that, sooner or later, the C Bonds at any rate
will be not only postponed, but canceled.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Committee of Guarantees.</i>&mdash;This new
body, which is to have a permanent office in Berlin,
is in form and status a sub&ndash;commission of the
Reparation Commission. Its members consist of
representatives of the Allies represented on the
Reparation Commission, with a representative of
the United States, if that country consents to
nominate.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> To it are assigned the various wide
and indefinite powers accorded by the Treaty of
Peace to the Reparation Commission, for the general
control and supervision of Germanyʼs financial
system. But its exact functions, in practice
and in detail, are still obscure.</p>

<p>According to the letter of its constitution the
Committee might embark on difficult and dangerous
functions. Accounts are to be opened in the
name of the Committee, to which will be paid over
in <i>gold or foreign currency</i> the proceeds of the
German Customs, 26 per cent of the value of all
exports and the proceeds of any other taxes which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
may be assigned as a “guarantee” for the payment
of Reparation. These receipts, however,
chiefly accrue not in gold or foreign currency, but
in paper marks. If the Committee attempts to
regulate the conversion of these paper marks into
foreign currencies, it will in effect become responsible
for the foreign exchange policy of Germany,
which it would be much more prudent to
leave alone. If not, it is difficult to see what the
“guarantees” really add to the other provisions
by which Germany binds herself to make payments
in foreign money.</p>

<p>I suspect that the only real and useful purpose
of the Committee of Guarantees is as an office of
the Reparation Commission <i>in Berlin</i>, a highly
necessary adjunct; and the clause about “guarantees”
is merely one more of the pretenses,
which, in all these agreements, the requirements of
politics intermingle with the provisions of finance.
It is usual, particularly in France, to talk much
about “guarantees,” by which is meant, apparently,
some device for making sure that the impossible
will occur. A “guarantee” is not the
same thing as a “sanction.” When M. Briand
is accused of weakness at the Second Conference
of London and of abandoning Franceʼs “real
guarantees,” these provisions enable him to repudiate
the charge indignantly. He can point out
that the Second Conference of London not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
set up a Committee of Guarantees but secured, as
a new and additional guarantee, the German Customs.
There is no answer to that!<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>3. <i>The Provisions for Payment in Cash and
Kind.</i>&mdash;The Bonds and the Guarantees are apparatus
and incantation. We come now to the
solid part of the settlement, the provisions for
payment.</p>

<p>Germany is to pay in each year, until her aggregate
liability is discharged:</p>

<p>(1)  Two milliard gold marks.</p>

<p>(2)  A sum equivalent to 26 per cent of the value
of her exports,  or alternatively an  equivalent
amount as fixed in accordance with any other index
proposed by Germany and accepted by the
Commission.</p>

<p>(1) is to be paid quarterly on January 15, April
15, July 15, and October 15 of each year, and (2)
is to be paid quarterly on February 15, May 15,
August 15, and November 15 of each year.</p>

<p>This sum, calculated on any reasonable estimate
of the future value of German exports, is materially
less than the original demands of the
Treaty. Germanyʼs total liability under the
Treaty amounts to 138 milliard gold marks (inclusive
of the liability for Belgian debt). At 5 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
cent interest and 1 per cent sinking fund, the annual
charge on this would be 8.28 milliard gold
marks. Under the new scheme the annual value
of Germanyʼs exports would have to rise to the
improbable figure of 24 milliard gold marks before
she would be liable for so much as this. As
we shall see below, the probable burden of the
new settlement in the near future is probably not
much more than half that of the Treaty.</p>

<p>There is another important respect in which
the demands of the Treaty are much abated. The
Treaty included a crushing provision by which
the part of Germanyʼs nominal liability on which
she was not able to pay interest in the early years
was to accumulate at compound interest.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> There
is no such provision in the new scheme; the C
Bonds are not to carry interest until the receipts
from Germany are adequate to meet their service;
and the only provision relating to back interest
is for the payment of <i>simple</i> interest in the event
of there being a surplus out of the receipts.</p>

<p>In order to understand how great an advance
this settlement represented it is necessary to carry
our minds back to the ideas which were prevalent
not very long ago. The following table is interesting,
in which, in order to reduce capital sums
and annual payments to a common basis of comparison,
estimates in terms of capital sums are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
replaced by annuities of 6 per cent of their
amount:</p>

<p>The estimate of The <i>Economic Consequences of
the Peace</i> (1919), namely 2 milliards, was nearly
contemporaneous with M. Klotzʼs figure of 18 milliards.
M. Tardieu recalls that, when the Peace
Conference was considering whether a definite figure
could be inserted in the Treaty, the lowest
figure which the British and French Prime Ministers
would accept, as a compromise to meet the
pressure put upon them by the American representatives,
corresponded to an annuity of 10.8
milliards,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> which is nearly two and a half times
the figure which they accepted two years later
under the pressure, not of Americans, but of facts.</p>

<p>There was yet another feature in the London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Settlement which recommended it to moderate
opinion. The dates of payment were so arranged
as to reduce the burden on Germany during the
first year. The Reparation year runs from May 1
in each year to April 30 in the next; but in the
period May 1, 1921&ndash;April 30, 1922 only two, instead
of four, of the quarterly payments in respect
of the export proportion will fall due.</p>

<p>No wonder, therefore, that this settlement, so
reasonable in itself compared with what had preceded
it, was generally approved and widely accepted
as a real and permanent solution. But in
spite of its importance for the time being, as a
preservative of peace, as affording a breathing
space, and as a transition from foolish expectations,
it cannot be a permanent solution. It is,
like all its predecessors, a temporizing measure,
which is bound to need amendment.</p>

<p>To calculate the total burden, it is necessary to
estimate the value of German exports. In 1920
they amounted to about 5 milliard gold marks. In
1921 the volume will be greater, but this will be
offset by the fact that gold prices have fallen to
less than two&ndash;thirds of what they were, so that 4
to 5 milliard gold marks is quite high enough as
a preliminary forecast for the year commencing
May 1, 1921.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> It is, of course, impossible to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
a close estimate for later years. The figures will
depend, not only on the recovery of Germany, but
on the state of international trade generally, and
more especially on the level of gold prices.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> For
the next two or three years, if we are to make an
estimate at all, 6 to 10 milliards is, in my judgment,
the best one can make.</p>

<p>Twenty&ndash;six per cent of exports, valued at 6 milliards
gold, will amount to about 1½ milliard gold
marks, making, with the fixed annual payment of
2 milliards, 3½ milliards altogether. If exports
rise to 10 milliards, the corresponding figure is
4½ milliards. The table of payments in the near
future is then as shown on the next page, all the
figures being in terms of milliards of gold marks.
In the case of payments after May 1, 1922, I give
alternative estimates on the basis of exports on
the scale of 6 and 10 milliards respectively.</p>

<p>Not the whole of these sums need be paid in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
cash, and the value of deliveries in kind is to be
credited to Germany against them. This item
has been estimated as high as 1.2 to 1.4 milliard
gold marks per annum. The result will chiefly
depend (1) on the amount and price of the coal
deliveries, and (2) on the degree of success which
attends the negotiations between France and Germany
for the supply by the latter of materials required
for the repair of the devastated area. The
value of the coal deliveries depends on factors already
discussed on p. 49, above, the <i>price</i> of the
coal being chiefly governed by the internal German
price. At a price of 20 gold marks per ton
and deliveries of 2,000,000 tons a month (neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of which figures are likely to be exceeded, or even
reached, in the near future), coal will yield credits
of .48 milliard gold marks. In the Loucheur&ndash;Rathenau
Agreement<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> the value of deliveries in
kind to France, including coal, over the next five
years has been estimated at a possible total of 1.4
milliard gold marks per annum. If France receives
.4 milliard gold marks in coal, not more than
35 per cent of the balance will be credited in the
Reparation account. If this were realized, the
aggregate deliveries in kind might approach 1 milliard.
But, for various reasons, political and economic,
this figure is unlikely to be reached, and
if as much as .75 milliards per annum is realized
from coal and reconstruction deliveries, this
ought to be considered a highly satisfactory result.</p>

<p>Now the payments were so arranged as to present
no insuperable difficulties during 1921. The
instalment of August 31, 1921 (which did not exceed
the sum which the Germans had themselves
offered for immediate payment in their counterproposal
of April 1921) was duly paid, partly out
of foreign balances accumulated before May 1
last, partly by selling out paper marks over the
foreign exchanges, and partly by temporary advances
from an international group of bankers.
The instalment of November 15,1921, was covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
by the value of deliveries of coal and other material
subsequent to May 1, 1921. Even the instalments
of January 15 and February 15, 1922,
might be covered out of further deliveries, temporary
advances, and the foreign assets of German
industrialists, if the German Government could
get hold of them. But the payment of April 15,
1922, must present more difficulty; whilst further
instalments follow quickly on May 15, July 15,
and August 15. Some time between February
and August 1922 Germany will succumb to an inevitable
default. This is the maximum extent of
our breathing space.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>That is to say, in so far as she depends for payment
(as in the long run she must do) on current
income. If capital, non&ndash;recurrent resources become
available, the above conclusion will require
modification accordingly. Germany still has an
important capital asset untouched&mdash;the property
of her nationals now sequestered in the hands of
the Enemy&ndash;Property Custodian in the United
States, of which the value is rather more than 1
milliard gold marks. If this were to become available
for Reparation, directly or indirectly, default<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
could be delayed correspondingly.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Similarly the
grant to Germany of foreign credits on a substantial
scale, even three&ndash;monthsʼ credits from bankers
on the security of the Reichsbankʼs gold, would
postpone the date a little, however useless in the
long run.</p>

<p>In reaching this conclusion, one can approach
the problem from three points of view: (1) the
problem of paying outside Germany, that is to say,
the problem of exports and the balance of trade;
(2) the problem of providing for payment by
taxation, that is to say, the problem of the Budget;
(3) the proportion of the sums demanded to the
German national income. I will take them in
turn, confining myself to what Germany can be
expected to perform in the near future, to the exclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of what she might do in hypothetical circumstances
many years hence.</p>

<p>(1) In order that Germany may be able to make
payments abroad, it is necessary, not only that
she should have exports, but that she should have
a surplus of exports over imports. In 1920, the
last complete year for which figures are available,
so far from a surplus there was a deficit, the exports
being valued at about 5 milliard gold marks
and the imports at 5.4 milliards. The figures for
1921 so far available indicate not an improvement
but a deterioration. The myth that Germany is
carrying on a vast and increasing export trade is
so widespread, that the actual figures for the six
months from May to October 1921, converted into
gold marks, may be given with advantage:</p>

<p>In respect of these six months Germany must
make a fixed payment of 1000 million gold marks
plus 26 per cent of the exports as above, namely
484.8 million gold marks, that is 1484.8 million
gold marks altogether, which is equal to about 80
per cent of her exports; whereas apart from any
Reparation payments, she had a <i>deficit</i> on her foreign
trade at the rate of more than 1 milliard
gold marks per annum. The bulk of Germanyʼs
imports are necessary either to her industries or
to the food supply of the country. It is therefore
certain that with exports of (say) 6 milliards
she could not cut her imports so low as to have the
surplus of 3&frac12; milliards, which would be necessary
to meet her Reparation liabilities. If, however,
her exports were to rise to 10 milliards, her Reparation
liabilities would become 4.6 milliards. Germany,
to meet her liabilities, must therefore raise
the gold&ndash;value of her exports to double what they
were in 1920 and 1921 <i>without increasing her imports
at all</i>.</p>

<p>I do not say that this is impossible, given time
and an overwhelming motive, and with active assistance
by the Allies to Germanyʼs export industries;
but does any one think it practicable
or likely in the actual circumstances of the case?
And if Germany succeeded, would not this vast
expansion of exports, unbalanced by imports, be
considered by our manufacturers to be her crowning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
crime? That this should be the case even
under the London Settlement of 1921 is a measure
of the ludicrous folly of the figures given out in
the British General Election of 1918, which were
six times as high again.</p>

<p>(2) Next there is the problem of the Budget.
For Reparation payments are a liability of the
German <i>Government</i> and must be covered by taxation.
At this point it is necessary to introduce
an assumption as to the relation between the gold
mark and the paper mark. For whilst the liability
is fixed in terms of gold marks, the revenue (or the
bulk of it) is collected in terms of paper marks.
The relation is a very fluctuating one, best measured
by the exchange value of the paper mark in
terms of American gold dollars. This fluctuation
is of more importance over short periods than in
the long run. For in the long run <i>all</i> values in
Germany, including the yield of taxation, will tend
to adjust themselves to an appreciation or depreciation
in the value of the paper mark outside
Germany. But the process may be a very slow
one, and, over the period covered by a yearʼs
budget, unanticipated fluctuations in the ratio of
the gold to the paper mark may upset entirely the
financial arrangements of the German Treasury.</p>

<p>This disturbance has of course occurred on an
unprecedented scale during the latter half of 1921.
Taxation in terms of paper marks, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
heavy when the dollar was worth 50 paper marks,
becomes very inadequate when the dollar is worth
200 paper marks; but it is beyond the power of
any Finance Minister to adjust taxation to such a
situation quickly. In the first place, when the fall
in the external value of the mark is proceeding
rapidly, the corresponding fall in the internal
value lags far behind. Until this adjustment has
taken place, which may occupy a considerable time
before it is complete, the taxable capacity of the
people, measured in gold, is less than it was before.
But even then a further interval must elapse before
the gold&ndash;value of the <i>yield</i> of taxation collectible
in paper marks can catch up. The experience
of the British Inland Revenue Department
well shows that the yield of direct taxation
must largely depend on the taxable assessments
of the <i>previous</i> period.</p>

<p>For these reasons the collapse of the mark exchange
must, if it persists, destroy beyond repair
the Budget of 1921&ndash;22, and probably that of the
first half of 1922&ndash;23 also. But I should be overstating
my argument if I were to base my conclusions
on the figures current at the end of 1921.
In the shifting sands in which the mark is foundering
it is difficult to find for oneʼs argument any
secure foothold.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1921 the gold mark was
worth, in round figures, 20 paper marks. The internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
purchasing power of the paper mark for
the purposes of working&ndash;class consumption was
still nearly double its corresponding value abroad,
so that one could scarcely say that equilibrium
had been established. Nevertheless, the position
was very well adjusted compared with what it has
since become. As I write (December 1921) the
gold mark has been fluctuating between 45 and
60 paper marks, while the purchasing power of
the paper mark inside Germany is for general
purposes perhaps three times what it is outside
Germany.</p>

<p>Since my figures of Government revenue and
expenditure are based on statements made in the
summer of 1921, perhaps my best course is to
take a figure of 20 paper marks to the gold mark.
The effect of this will be to understate my argument
rather than the contrary. The reader must
remember that, if the mark remains at its present
exchange value long enough for internal values to
adjust themselves to that rate, the items in the
following account, the income and the outgoings
and the deficit, will all tend to be multiplied threefold.</p>

<p>At this ratio (of 20 paper marks=1 gold
mark), a Reparation liability of 3½ milliard gold
marks (assuming exports on the scale of 6 milliards)
is equivalent to 70 milliard paper marks,
and a liability of 4½ milliards (assuming exports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of 10 milliards) is equivalent to 90 milliard paper
marks. The German Budget for the financial year
April 1, 1921, to March 31, 1922, provided for an
expenditure of 93.5 milliards, exclusive of Reparation
payments, and for a revenue of 59 milliards.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Thus the present Reparation demand
would by itself absorb more than the whole of the
existing revenue. Doubtless expenditure can be
cut down, and revenue somewhat increased. But
the Budget will not cover even the lower scale of
the Reparation payments unless expenditure is
halved and revenue doubled.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>If the German Budget for 1922&ndash;23 manages to
balance, <i>apart</i> from any provision for Reparation,
this will represent a great effort and a considerable
achievement. Apart, however, from the technical
financial difficulties, there is a political and
social aspect of the question which deserves attention
here. The Allies deal with the established
German Government, make bargains with them,
and look to them for fulfilment. The Allies do
not extract payment out of individual Germans
direct; they put pressure on the transitory abstraction
called Government, and leave it to this
to determine and to enforce which individuals are
to pay, and how much. Since at the present time
the German Budget is far from balancing even if
there were no Reparation payments at all, it is
fair to say that not even a beginning has yet been
made towards settling the problem of how the
burden is to be distributed between different
classes and different interests.</p>

<p>Yet this problem is fundamental. Payment
takes on a different aspect when, instead of being
expressed in terms of milliards and as a liability
of the transitory abstraction, it is translated into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
a demand for a definite sum from a specific individual.
This stage is not yet reached, and until
it is reached the full intrinsic difficulty will not
be felt. For at this stage the struggle ceases to
be primarily one between the Allies and the German
Government and becomes a struggle between
different sections and classes of Germans. The
struggle will be bitter and violent, for it will present
itself to each of the contesting interests as an
affair of life and death. The most powerful influences
and motives of self&ndash;interest and self&ndash;preservation
will be engaged. Conflicting conceptions
of the end and nature of Society will be ranged
in conflict. A Government which makes a serious
attempt to cover its liabilities will inevitably fall
from power.</p>

<p>(3) What relation do the demands bear to the
third test of capacity, the present income of the
German people? A burden of 70 milliard paper
marks (if we may, provisionally, adopt that figure
as the basis of our calculations) amounts, since the
population is now about 60 millions, to 1170 marks
per head for every man, woman, and child.</p>

<p>The great changes in money values have made
it difficult, in all countries, to obtain estimates of
the national income in terms of money under the
new conditions. The Brussels Conference of
1920, on the basis of inquiries made in 1919 and
at the beginning of 1920, estimated the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
income per head at 3900 paper marks. This figure
may have been too low at the time, and, on
account of the further depreciation of the mark,
is certainly too low now. A writer in the
<i>Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</i> (Feb. 14, 1921),
working on the statistics of statutory deductions
from wages and on income&ndash;tax, arrived at a figure
of 2333 marks per head. This figure also is likely
to be too low, partly because the statistics must
mainly refer to earlier dates when the mark was
less depreciated, and partly because all such statistics
necessarily suffer from evasions. At the
other extreme lies the estimate of Dr. Albert
Lansburgh, who, by implication (<i>Die Bank</i>, March
1921), estimated the income per head at 6570
marks.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Another recent estimate is that of Dr.
Arthur Heichen in the <i>Pester Lloyd</i> (June 5,
1921), who put the figure at 4450 marks. In a
newspaper article published in various quarters
in August 1921 I ventured to adopt the figure of
5000 marks as the nearest estimate I could make.
In fixing on this figure I was influenced by the
above estimates, and also by statistics as to the
general level of salaries and wages. Since then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
I have looked into the matter further and am still
of the opinion that this figure was high enough
for that date.</p>

<p>I am fortified in this conclusion by the result
of inquiries which I addressed to Dr. Moritz Elsas
of Frankfort&ndash;on&ndash;Main, on whose authority I quote
the following figures. The best&ndash;known estimate
of the German pre&ndash;war income is Helfferichʼs in
his <i>Deutschlands Volkswohlstand</i> 1888&ndash;1913. In
this volume he put the national income in 1913
at 40&ndash;41 milliard gold marks, <i>plus</i> 2½ milliards
for net income from nationalized concerns (railways,
post office, etc.), that it is say, an aggregate
of 43 milliards or 642 marks per head. Starting
from the figure of 41 milliards (since the national
services no longer produce a profit) and
deducting 15 per cent for loss of territory, we have
a figure of 34.85 milliards. What multiplier ought
we to apply to this in order to arrive at the present
income in terms of paper marks? In 1920
commercial employees obtained on the average in
terms of marks 4½ times their pre&ndash;war income,
whilst at that time workmen had secured an increase
in their nominal wages of 50 per cent more
than this, that is to say, their wages were 6 to 8
times the pre&ndash;war figure. According to the Statistischen
Reichsamt (<i>Wirtschaft und Statistik</i>,
Heft 4, Jahrgang 1) commercial employees at the
beginning of 1921 earned, males 6⅔ times and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
females 10 times as much as in 1913.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> On the
basis of the same proportion as in 1920 we arrive
at an increase of 10 times in the nominal wages
of workmen. The wages index number of the
<i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> for August 1921 estimates
the wages per hour at 11 times the pre&ndash;war level,
but, as the number of working hours has fallen
from 10 to 8, these figures yield an increase of
8.8 times in the wage actually received. Since
the wages of male commercial employees have increased
less than this, since business profits in
terms of paper marks only reach this figure of
increase in exceptional cases, and since the income
of the rentier, landlord, and professional
classes has increased in a far lower proportion,
an estimate of an 8&ndash;fold increase in the nominal
income of the country as a whole at that date
(August 1921) is likely to be an over&ndash;estimate
rather than an under&ndash;estimate. This leads to an
aggregate national income, on the basis of the
Helfferich pre&ndash;war figures, of 278.80 milliard
paper marks, and to an income of 4647 marks per
head in August 1921.</p>

<p>No allowance is made here for the loss by war
of men in the prime of life, for the loss of external
income previously earned from foreign investment
and the mercantile marine, or for the increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of officials. Against these omissions there
may be set off the decrease of the army and the
increased number of women employees.</p>

<p>The extreme instability of economic conditions
makes it almost impossible to conduct a direct statistical
inquiry into this problem at the present
time. In such circumstances the general method
of Dr. Elsas seems to me to be the best available.
His results show that the figure taken above is
of the right general dimensions and is not likely
to be widely erroneous. It enables us, too, to put
an upper limit of reasonable possibility on our
figures. No one, I think, would maintain that in
August 1921 nominal incomes in Germany averaged
10 times their pre&ndash;war level; and 10 times
Helfferichʼs pre&ndash;war estimate comes to 6420
marks. <i>No</i> statistics of national incomes are very
precise, but an assertion that in the middle of 1921
the German income per head per annum lay between
4500 marks and 6500 marks, and that it was
probably much nearer the lower than the higher
of these figures, say 5000 marks, is about as near
the truth as we shall get.</p>

<p>In view of the instability of the mark, it is, of
course, the case that such estimates do not hold
good for any length of time and need constant revision.
Nevertheless this fact does not upset the
following calculation as much as might be supposed,
because it operates to a certain extent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
both sides of the account. If the mark depreciates
further, the average income per head in
paper marks will tend to rise; but in this event
the equivalent in paper marks of the Reparation
liability will, since it is expressed in terms of <i>gold</i>
marks, rise also. A real alleviation can only result
from a fall in the value of <i>gold</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, a rise
in world prices).</p>

<p>To the taxation in respect of the Reparation
charge there must be added the burden of Germanyʼs
own government, central and local. By
the most extreme economies, short of repudiation
of war loans and war pensions, this burden could
hardly be brought below 1000 paper marks per
head (at 20 paper marks=1 gold mark), <i>i.e.</i>, 60
milliards altogether, a figure greatly below the
present expenditure. In the aggregate, therefore,
2170 marks out of the average income of
5000 marks, or 43 per cent, would go in taxation.
If exports rise to 10 milliards (gold) and the average
income to 6000 paper marks, the corresponding
figures are 2500 marks and 42 per cent.</p>

<p>There are circumstances in which a wealthy nation,
impelled by overwhelming motives of self&ndash;interest,
might support this burden. But the annual
income of 5000 paper marks per head is
equivalent in exchange value (at an exchange of
20 paper marks to 1 gold mark) to $62.50, and
after deduction of taxation to about $35, that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
to say to less than 10 cents a day, which in August
1921 was the equivalent in purchasing power in
Germany of something between 20 cents and 25
cents in the United States.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> If Germany was given
a respite, her income and with it her capacity
would increase; but under her present burdens,
which render saving impossible, a degradation of
standards is more likely. Would the whips and
scorpions of any Government recorded in history
have been efficient to extract nearly half their
income from a people so situated?</p>

<p>For these reasons I conclude that whilst the
Settlement of London granted a breathing space
to the end of 1921, it can be no more permanent
than its predecessors.</p>

<h3 class="p2">EXCURSUS III</h3>

<p class="pn center">THE  WIESBADEN  AGREEMENT</p>

<p class="pn p1">In the summer of 1921 much interest was excited
by reports of confidential interviews between M.
Loucheur and Herr Rathenau, the Ministers of
Reconstruction in France and Germany respectively.
An agreement was provisionally reached
in August 1921 and was finally signed at Wiesbaden
on October 6, 1921<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>; but it does not come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
into force until it has received the approval of
the Reparation Commission. This Commission,
whilst approving the general principles underlying
it, have referred it to the principal Allied Governments
on the ground that it involves departures
from the Treaty of Versailles beyond their own
competence to authorize. The British delegate,
Sir John Bradbury, has advised his Government
that the Agreement should be approved subject
to certain modifications which he sets forth; and
his Report has been published.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The Wiesbaden Agreement is a complicated document.
But the essence of it is easily explained.
It falls into two distinct parts. First, it sets up
a procedure by which private French firms can
acquire from private German firms materials required
for reconstruction in France, without
France having to make payment in cash. Secondly,
it provides that, whilst Germany is not to
receive payment at once for any part of these
goods, only a proportion of the sum due is credited
to her immediately in the books of the Reparation
Commission, the balance being advanced by her
to France for the time being and only brought
into the Reparation account at a later date.</p>

<p>The first set of provisions has met with unqualified
approval from every one. An arrangement
which may possibly stimulate payment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Reparation in the form of actual materials for
the reconstruction of the devastated districts satisfies
convenience, economics, and sentiment in a
peculiarly direct way. But such supplies were
already arranged for under the Treaty, and the
chief value of the new procedure lies in its replacing
the machinery of the Reparation Commission
by direct negotiation between the French
and German authorities.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The second set of provisions is, however, of a
different character, since it interferes with the
existing agreements between the Allies themselves
as to the order and proportions in which each is
to share in the available receipts from Germany,
and seeks to secure for France a larger share
of the earlier payments than she would receive
otherwise. A priority to France is, in my opinion,
desirable; but such priority should be accorded
as part of a general re&ndash;settlement of Reparation,
in which Great Britain should waive her
claim entirely. Further, the Agreement involves
an act of doubtful good faith on the part of Germany.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
She has been protesting with great vehemence
(and, I believe, with perfect truth) that
the Decisions of London exact from her more than
she can perform. But in such circumstances it
is an act of impropriety for her to enter voluntarily
into an agreement which must have the
effect, if it is operative, of further increasing her
liabilities even beyond those against which she
protests as impossible. Herr Rathenau may justify
his action by the arguments that this is a
first step towards replacing the Decisions of London
by more sensible arrangements, and also that,
if he can placate Germanyʼs largest and most
urgent creditor in the shape of France, he has
not much to fear from the others. M. Loucheur,
on the other hand, may know as well as I do,
though speaking otherwise, that the Decisions of
London cannot be carried out, and that the time
for a more realistic policy is at hand; he may
even regard his interviews with Herr Rathenau
as a foretaste of more intimate relationships between
business interests on the two sides of the
Rhine. But these considerations, if we were to
pursue them, would lead us to a different plane of
argument.</p>

<p>Sir John Bradbury in his Report<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> on the Agreement
to the British Government has proposed
certain modifications which would have the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of preserving the advantages of the first set of
provisions, but of nullifying the latter so far as
they could operate to the detriment of Franceʼs
Allies.</p>

<p>I consider, however, that exaggerated importance
has been attached to this topic, since the
actual deliveries of goods made under the Wiesbaden
or similar agreements are not likely to be
worth such large sums of money as are spoken
of. Deliveries of coal, dyestuffs, and ships, dealt
with in the Annexes to Part VIII. of the Treaty
are specifically excluded from the operation of
the Wiesbaden Agreement which is expressly
limited to deliveries of plant and material, and
these France undertakes to apply <i>solely</i> to the
reconstitution of the devastated regions. The
quantities of goods, which French firms and individuals
will be ready to order from Germany
at the full market price, and which Germany can
supply, for this limited purpose (so great a part
of the cost of which is necessarily due to <i>labor</i>
employed on the spot and not to materials capable
of being imported from Germany), are not likely
to amount, during the next five years, to a sum
of money which the other Allies need grudge
France as a priority claim.</p>

<p>My other reserve relates to the supposed importance
of the Wiesbaden Agreement as a precedent
for similar arrangements with the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Allies, and raises the general issue of the utility
of arrangements for securing that Germany
should pay in kind rather than in cash, for
other purposes than those of the devastated
areas.</p>

<p>It is commonly believed that, if our demands
on Germany are met by her delivering to us not
cash but particular commodities selected by ourselves,
we can thus avoid the competition of German
products against our own in the markets of
the world, which must result if we compel her to
find foreign currency by selling goods abroad at

<p>Most suggestions in favor of our being paid in
kind are too vague to be criticized. But they usually
suffer from the confusion of supposing that
there is some advantage in our being paid directly
in kind even in the case of articles which
Germany might be expected to export in any case.
For example, the Annexes to the Treaty which
deal with deliveries in kind chiefly relate to coal,
dyestuffs, and ships. These certainly do not satisfy
the criterion of not competing with our own
products; and I see very little advantage, but
on the other hand some loss and inconvenience,
in the Alliesʼ receiving these goods direct, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of Germanyʼs selling them in the best market and
paying over the proceeds. In the case of coal
in particular, it would be much better if Germany
sold her output for cash in the best export
markets, whether to France and Belgium or to
the neighboring neutrals, and then paid the cash
over to France and Belgium, than that coal should
be delivered to the Allies for which the latter may
have no immediate use, or by transport routes
which are uneconomical, when neutrals need the
coal and what the Allies really require is the
equivalent cash. In some cases the Allies have
re&ndash;sold the coal which Germany has delivered to
them,&mdash;a procedure which, in the case of an article
for which freight charges cover so large a
proportion of the whole value, involves a preposterous
waste.</p>

<p>If we try to stipulate the precise commodities
in which Germany is to pay us, we shall not secure
from her so large a contribution, as if we fix a
reasonable sum which is within her capacity, and
then leave her to find the money as best she can.
If, moreover, the sum fixed is reasonable, the
annual payments will not be so large, in proportion
to the total volume of international trade,
that Great Britain need be nervous lest the payments
upset the normal equilibrium of her economic
life in any greater degree than is bound
to result in any case from the gradual economic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
recovery of so formidable a trade rival as pre&ndash;war
Germany.</p>

<p>Whilst I make these observations in the interests
of scientific accuracy, I admit that projects,
for insisting on payment in kind may be
very useful politically as a means of escaping
out of our present <i>impasse</i>. In practice the value
of such deliveries would turn out to be immensely
less than the cash we are now demanding; but
it may be easier to substitute deliveries of materials
in place of cash, which will in practice
result in a great abatement of our demands, than
to abate the latter in so many words. Moreover,
protests, against leaving Germany free to pay
us in cash by selling goods how and where she
can, enlist on the side of revision all the latent
Protectionist sentiment which still abounds. If
Germany were to make a strenuous effort to pay
us by exploiting the only method open to her,
namely, by selling as many goods as possible at
low prices all over the world, it would not be
long before many minds would represent this
effort as a plot to ruin us; and persons of this
way of thinking will be most easily won over, if
we describe a reduction in our demands, as a
prohibition to Germany against developing a
nefarious competitive trade. Such a way of expressing
a desirable change of policy combines,
with a basis of truth, sufficient false doctrine to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
enable <i>The Times</i>, for example, to recommend it
in a leading article without feeling conscious of
any intellectual inconsistency; and it furnishes
what so many people are now looking for, namely,
a pretext for behaving sensibly, without having
to suffer the indignity and inconvenience of thinking
and speaking so too. Heaven forbid that I
should discourage them! It is only too rarely
that a good cause can summon to its assistance
arguments sufficiently mixed to insure success.</p>

<h3 class="p2">EXCURSUS IV</h3>

<p class="pn center">THE MARK EXCHANGE</p>

<p class="pn p1">The gold value of a countryʼs inconvertible paper
money may fall, either because the Government
is spending more than it is raising by loans and
taxes and is meeting the balance by issuing paper
money, or because the country is under the obligation
of paying increased sums to foreigners for
the purchase of investments or in discharge of
debts. Temporarily it may be affected by speculation,
that is to say by <i>anticipation</i>, whether
well or ill founded, that one or other of the above
influences will operate shortly; but the influence
of speculation is generally much exaggerated, because
of the immense effect which it may exercise
momentarily. Both influences can only operate
through the balance of debts, due for immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
payment, between the country in question and the
rest of the world: the liability to make payments
to foreigners operating on this directly; and the
inflation of the currency operating on it indirectly,
either because the additional paper money stimulates
imports and retards exports, by increasing
local purchasing power at the existing level of
values or because the expectation that it will so
act causes anticipatory speculation. The expansion
of the currency can have no effect whatever
on the exchanges until it reacts on imports and
exports, or encourages speculation; and as the
latter cancels out, sooner or later, the effect of
currency expansion on the exchanges can only last
by reacting on imports and exports.</p>

<p>These principles can be applied without difficulty
to the exchange value of the mark since 1920. At
first the various influences were not all operating
in the same direction. Currency inflation tended
to depreciate the mark; so did foreign investment
by Germans (the “flight from the mark”); but
investment by foreigners in German Bonds and
German currency (an exact line between which
and short&ndash;period speculation it is not easy to
draw) operated sharply in the other direction.
After the mark had fallen to such a level that
more than 25 marks could be obtained for a dollar,
numerous persons all over the world formed the
opinion that there would be a reaction some day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
to the pre&ndash;war value, and that therefore a purchase
of marks or mark Bonds would be a good
investment. This investment proceeded on so vast
a scale that it placed foreign currency at the
disposal of Germany up to an aggregate value
which has been estimated at from $800,000,000 to
$1,000,000,000. These resources enabled Germany,
partially at least, to replenish her food supplies
and to restock her industries with raw materials,
requirements involving an excess of imports over
exports which could not otherwise have been paid
for. In addition it even enabled individual Germans
to remove a part of their wealth from Germany
for investment in other countries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile currency inflation was proceeding.
In the course of the year 1920 the note circulation
of the Reichsbank approximately doubled,
whilst on balance the exchange value of the mark
had deteriorated only slightly as compared with
the beginning of that year.</p>

<p>Moreover, up to the end of 1920 and even during
the first quarter of 1921 Germany had made
no cash payments for Reparation and had even
<i>received</i> cash (under the Spa Agreement) for
a considerable part of her coal deliveries.</p>

<p>After the middle of 1921, however, the various
influences, which up to that time had partly balanced
one another, began to work all in one direction,
that is to say, adversely to the value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the mark. Currency inflation continued, and during
1921 the note circulation of the Reichsbank
was nearly trebled, bringing it up to nearly six
times what it had been two years earlier. Imports
steadily exceeded exports in value. Some
foreign investors in marks began to take fright
and, so far from increasing their holdings, sought
to diminish them. And now at last the German
Government was called on to make important cash
payments on Reparation account. Sales of marks
from Germany, instead of being absorbed by foreign
investors, had now to be made in competition
with sales from these same investors. Naturally
the mark collapsed. It had to fall to a value
at which new buyers would come forward or at
which sellers would hold off.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>There is no mystery here, nothing but what is
easily explained. The credence attached to stories
of a “German plot” to depreciate the mark wilfully
is further evidence of the overwhelming popular
ignorance of the influences governing the exchanges,
an ignorance already displayed, to the
great pecuniary advantage of Germany, by the
international craze to purchase mark notes.</p>

<p>In its later stages the collapse has been mainly
due to the necessity of paying money abroad in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
discharge of Reparation and in repaying foreign
investors in marks, with the result that the fall
in the external value of the mark has outstripped
any figure which could be justified merely as a
consequence of the present degree of currency
inflation. Germany would require a much larger
note issue than at present, if German internal
prices were to become adjusted to gold prices at
an exchange of more than 400 marks to the dollar.[1]
If, therefore, the other influences were to
be removed, if, that is to say, the Reparation demands
were revised and foreign investors were
to take heart again, a sharp recovery might occur.
On the other hand, a serious attempt by
Germany to meet the Reparation demands would
cause the expenditure of her Government to exceed
its income by so great an amount, that currency
inflation and the internal price level would
catch up in due course the external depreciation
in the mark.</p>

<p>In either event Germany is faced with an unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
prospect. If the present exchange depreciation
persists and the internal price level
becomes adjusted to it, the resulting redistribution
of wealth between different classes of the
community will amount to a social catastrophe.
If, on the other hand, there is a recovery in the
exchange, the cessation of the existing artificial
stimulus to industry and of the Stock Exchange
boom based on the depreciating mark may lead
to a financial catastrophe.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Those responsible for
the financial policy of Germany have a problem
of incomparable difficulty in front of them. Until
the Reparation liability has been settled reasonably,
it is scarcely worth the while of any
one to trouble his head about a problem which
is insoluble. When stabilization has become a
practicable policy, the wisest course will probably
be to stabilize at whatever level prices and trade
seem most nearly adjusted to at that date.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="pf"><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> I have allowed nothing so far for the costs of the Armies of
Occupation, which, under the letter of the Treaty, Germany is
under obligation to pay in addition to the sums due for Reparation
proper. As these charges rank in priority ahead of Reparation,
and as the London Agreement does not deal with them, I
think Germany is liable to be called on to pay these as they
accrue in addition to the annuities fixed in the London Settlement.
But I am doubtful whether the Allies intend in fact to
demand this. Hitherto the expense of the Armies has been so
great as to absorb virtually the whole of the receipts (see Excursus
V. below), having amounted by the middle of 1921 to
about $1,000,000,000. In any case, it is now time that the agreement,
signed at Paris in 1919 by Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and
Wilson, should be brought into force, to the effect that the sum
payable annually by Germany to cover the cost of occupation
shall be limited to 240 million gold marks as soon as the Allies
“are convinced that the conditions of disarmament by Germany
are being satisfactorily fulfilled.” If we assume that this reduced
figure is brought into force, as it ought to be, the total
burden on Germany for Separation and Occupation comes, on the
assumption of the lower figure for exports, to 3.8 milliard gold
marks, that is, to 76 milliard paper marks.</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">The Reparation Bill</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">The Treaty of Versailles specified the classes of
damage in respect of which Germany was to pay
Reparation. It made no attempt to assess the
amount of this damage. This duty was assigned
to the Reparation Commission, who were instructed
to notify their assessment to the German
Government on or before May 1, 1921.</p>

<p>An attempt was made during the Peace Conference
to agree to a figure there and then for
insertion in the Treaty. The American delegates
in particular favored this course. But an agreement
could not be reached. There was no reasonable
figure which was not seriously inadequate
to popular expectations in France and the British
Empire.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The highest figure to which the Americans
would agree, namely, 140 milliard gold
marks, was, as we shall see later, not much above
the eventual assessment of the Reparation Commission;
the lowest figure to which France and
Great Britain would agree, namely, 180 milliard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
gold marks, was, as it has turned out, much above
the amount to which they were entitled even under
their own categories of claim.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Between the date of the Treaty and the announcement
of its decision by the Reparation Commission,
there was much controversy as to what
this amount should be. I propose to review some
of the details of this problem, because, if men
are in any way actuated by veracity in international
affairs, a just opinion about it is still relevant
to the Reparation problem.</p>

<p>The main contentions of <i>The Economic Consequences
of the Peace</i> were these: (1) that the
claims against Germany which the Allies were
contemplating were impossible of payment; (2)
that the economic solidarity of Europe was so
close that the attempt to enforce these claims
might ruin every one; (3) that the money cost
of the damage done by the enemy in France and
Belgium had been exaggerated; (4) that the inclusion
of pensions and allowances in our claims
was a breach of faith; and (5) that our legitimate
claim against Germany was within her capacity
to pay.</p>

<p>I have made some supplementary observations
about (1) and (2) in Chapters III. and VI. I deal
with (3) here and in Chapter V. with (4). These
latter are still important. For, whilst time is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
dealing with (1) and (2) that very few people
now dispute them, the amount of our legitimate
claim against Germany has not been brought into
so sharp a focus by the pressure of events. Yet
if my contention about this can be substantiated,
the world will find it easier to arrange a practical
settlement. The claims of justice in this connection
are generally thought to be opposed to those
of possibility, so that even if the pressure of
events drives us reluctantly to admit that the
latter must prevail, the former will rest unsatisfied.
If, on the other hand, restricting ourselves
to the devastations in France and Belgium, we can
demonstrate that it is within the capacity of
Germany to make full reparation, a harmony of
sentiment and action can be established.</p>

<p>With this end in view it is necessary that I
should take up again, in the light of the fuller
information now available, the statements which
I made in <i>The Economic Consequences of the
Peace</i> (p. 120) to the effect that “the amount
of the material damage done in the invaded districts
has been the subject of enormous, if natural,
exaggeration.” These statements have involved
me in a charge, with which Frenchmen as
eminent as M. Clemenceau<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and M. Poincaré have
associated themselves, that I was actuated not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
by the truth but by a supposed hostility to France
in speaking thus of the allegations of M. Klotz
and M. Loucheur and some other Frenchmen. But
I still urge on France that her cause may be
served by accuracy and the avoidance of overstatement;
that the damage she has suffered is
more likely to be made good if the amount is
possible than if it is impossible; and that, the
more moderate her claims are, the more likely
she is to win the support of the world in securing
priority for them. M. Brenier, in particular, has
conducted a widespread propaganda with the object
of creating prejudice against my statistics.
Yet to add a large number of noughts at the end
of an estimate is not really an indication of nobility
of mind. Nor, in the long run, are those
persons good advocates of Franceʼs cause who
bring her name into contempt and her sincerity
into doubt by using figures wildly. We shall never
get to work with the restoration of Europe unless
we can bring not only experts, but the public, to
consider coolly what material damage France has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
suffered and what material resources of reparation
Germany commands. <i>The Times</i>, in a leading
article which accompanied some articles by
M. Brenier (December 4, 1920), wrote with an
air of noble contempt&mdash;“Mr. Keynes treats their
losses as matter for statistics.” But chaos and
poverty will continue as long as we insist on treating
statistics as an emotional barometer and as
a convenient vehicle of sentiment. In the following
examination of figures let us agree that we
are employing them to measure facts and not as
a literary expression of love or hate.</p>

<p>Leaving on one side for the present the items
of pensions and allowances and loans to Belgium,
let us examine the data relating to the material
damage in Northern France. The claims made
by the French Government did not vary very
much from the spring of 1919, when the Peace
Conference was sitting, down to the spring of
1921, when the Reparation Commission was deciding
its assessment, though the fluctuations in
the value of the franc over that period cause
some confusion. Early in 1919 M. Dubois, speaking
on behalf of the Budget Commission of the
Chamber, gave the figure of 65 milliard francs
“as a minimum,” and on February 17, 1919, M.
Loucheur, speaking before the Senate as Minister
of Industrial Reconstruction, estimated the cost
at 75 milliards at the prices then prevailing. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
September 5, 1919, M. Klotz, addressing the Chamber
as Minister of Finance, put the total French
claims for damage to property (presumably inclusive
of losses at sea, etc.) at 134 milliards. In
July 1920 M. Dubois, by that time President of
the Reparation Commission, in a Report for the
Brussels and Spa Conferences, put the figure at
62 milliards on the basis of pre&ndash;war prices.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> In
January 1921 M. Doumer, speaking as Finance
Minister, put the figure at 110 milliards. The
actual claim which the French Government submitted
to the Reparation Commission in April
1921 was for 127 milliard paper francs at current
prices.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> By that time the exchange value of the
franc, and also its purchasing power, had considerably
depreciated, and, allowing for this, there
is not so great a discrepancy as appears at first
sight between the above estimates.</p>

<p>For the assessment of the Reparation Commission
it was necessary to convert this claim from
paper francs into gold marks. The rate to be
adopted for this purpose was the subject of acute
controversy. On the basis of the actual rate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
exchange prevailing at that date (April 1921) the
gold mark was worth about 3.25 paper francs.
The French representatives claimed that this depreciation
was temporary and that a permanent
settlement ought not to be based on it. They
asked, therefore, for a rate of about frs. 1.50 or
frs. 1.75 to the gold mark.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The question was
eventually submitted to the arbitration of Mr.
Boyden, the American member of the Reparation
Commission, who, like most arbitrators, took a
middle course and decided that 2.20 paper francs
should be deemed equivalent to 1 gold mark.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> He
would probably have found it difficult to give a
reason for this decision. As regards that part of
the claim which was in respect of pensions, a forecast
of the gold value of the franc, however impracticable,
was relevant. But as regards that
part which was in respect of material damage, no
such adjustment was necessary<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>; for the French
claim had been drawn up on the basis of the current
costs of reconstruction, the gold equivalent
of which need not be expected to rise with an
increase in the gold value of the franc, an improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
in the exchange being balanced sooner
or later by a fall in franc prices. It might have
been proper to make allowance for any premium
existing, at the date of the assessment, on the
internal purchasing power of the franc over that
of its external exchange&ndash;equivalent in gold. But
in April 1921 the franc was not far from its proper
“purchasing power parity,” and I calculate that
on this basis it would have been approximately accurate
to have equated the gold mark with 3 paper
francs. The rate of 2.20 had the effect, therefore,
of inflating the French claim against Germany
very materially.</p>

<p>At this rate the claim of 127 milliard paper
francs for material damage was equivalent to
57.7 milliard gold marks, of which the chief items
were as follows:</p>

<p>This total is one which I believe to be a vast,
indeed a fantastic, exaggeration beyond anything
which it would be possible to justify under cross&ndash;examination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
At the date when I wrote <i>The Economic
Consequences of the Peace</i>, exact statistics
as to the damage done were not available, and
it was only possible to fix a maximum limit to a
reasonable claim, having regard to the pre&ndash;war
wealth of the invaded districts. Now, however,
much more detail is available with which to check
the claim.</p>

<p>The following particulars are quoted from a
statement made by M. Briand in the French Senate
on April 6, 1921, supplemented by an official
memorandum published a few days later, and represent
the position at about that date:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>(1) The population inhabiting the devastated
districts in April 1921 was 4,100,000, as compared
with 4,700,000 in 1914.</p>

<p>(2) Of the cultivable land 95 per cent of the
surface had been releveled and 90 per cent had
been plowed and was producing crops.</p>

<p>(3) 293,733 houses were totally destroyed, in
replacement of which 132,000 provisional dwellings
of different kinds had been erected.</p>

<p>(4) 296,502 houses were partially destroyed,
of which 281,300 had been repaired.</p>

<p>(5) Fifty per cent of the factories were again
working.</p>

<p>(6) Out of 2404 kilometers of railway destroyed,
practically the whole had been reconstructed.</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, that, apart from refurnishing
and from the rebuilding of houses and factories,
the greater part of which had still to be
accomplished, the bulk of the devastation was already
made good out of the daily labor of France
within two years of the Peace Conference, before
Germany had paid anything.</p>

<p>This is a great achievement,&mdash;one more demonstration
of the riches accruing to France from the
patient industry of peasants, which makes her one
of the rich countries of the world, in spite of the
corrupt Parisian finance which for a generation
past has wasted the savings of her investors.
When we look at Northern France we see what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
honest Frenchmen can accomplish.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> But when
we turn to the money claims which are based on
this, we are back in the atmosphere of Parisian
finance,&mdash;so grasping, faithless, and extravagantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
unveracious as to defeat in the end its own objects.</p>

<p>For let us compare some of these items of devastation
with the claims lodged.</p>

<p>(1) 293,733 houses were totally destroyed and
296,502 were partially destroyed. Since nearly all
the latter have been repaired, we shall not be
underestimating the damage in assuming, for the
purposes of a rough comparison, that, on the average,
the damaged houses were <i>half</i> destroyed,
which gives us altogether the equivalent of 442,000
houses totally destroyed. Turning back, we
find that the French Governmentʼs claim for damage
to houses was 16,768 million gold marks, that
is to say $4,192,000,000. Dividing this sum by the
number of houses, we find an average claim of
$9,480, per house!<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> This is a claim for what were
chiefly peasantsʼ and minersʼ cottages and the tenements
of small country towns. M. Tardieu has
quoted M. Loucheur as saying that the houses in
the Lens&ndash;Courrières district were worth 5000
francs ($1000) a&ndash;piece before the war, but would
cost 15,000 francs to rebuild after the war, which
sounds not at all unreasonable. In April 1921
the cost of building construction in Paris (which
had been a good deal higher some months before)
was estimated to be, in terms of paper francs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
three and a half times the pre&ndash;war figure.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> But
even if we take the cost in francs at five times the
pre&ndash;war figure, namely 25,000 paper francs per
house, the claim lodged by the French Government
is still three and a half times the truth. I fancy
that the discrepancy, here and also under other
heads, may be partly explained by the inclusion
in the official French claim of indirect damages,
namely, for loss of rent&mdash;<i>perte de loyer</i>. It does
not appear what attitude the Reparation Commission
took up towards <i>indirect</i> pecuniary and business
losses arising in the devastated districts out
of the war. But I do not think that such claims
are admissible under the Treaty. Such losses, real
though they were, were not essentially different
from analogous losses occurring in other areas,
and indeed throughout the territory of the Allies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
The maximum claim, however, on this head would
not go far towards justifying the above figure,
and we can allow a considerable margin of error
for such additional items without impairing the
conclusion that the claim is exaggerated. In <i>The
Economic Consequences of the Peace</i> (p. 127) I
estimated that $1,250,000,000 might be a fair estimate
for damage to house property; and I still
think that this was about right.</p>

<p>(2) This claim for damage to houses is exclusive
of furniture and fittings, which are the
subject of a separate claim, namely, for 11,417
million gold marks, or about $2,850,000,000. To
check this figure let us assume that the whole of
the furniture and fittings were destroyed, not only
where the houses were destroyed, but also in every
case where a house was damaged. This is an
overstatement, but we may set it off against the
fact that in a good many cases the furniture may
have been looted and not recovered by restitution
(a large amount has, in fact, been recovered in
this way), although the structure of the house was
not damaged at all. The total number of houses
damaged or destroyed was 590,000. Dividing this
into $2,850,000,000, we have an average of nearly
$5,000 per house&mdash;an average valuation of the
furniture and fittings in each peasantʼs or collierʼs
house of nearly $5,000! I hesitate to guess
how great an overstatement shows itself here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) The largest claim of all, however, is for
“industrial damages,” namely, 17,673 million gold
marks, or about $4,400,000,000. In 1919 M. Loucheur
estimated the cost of reconstruction of the
coal mines at 2000 million francs, that is $400,000,000
at the par of exchange.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> As the pre&ndash;war
value of all the coal mines in Great Britain was
estimated at only $650,000,000, and as the pre&ndash;war
output of the British mines was fifteen times
that of the invaded districts of France, this figure
seems high.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> But even if we accept it, there is
still four thousand million dollars to account for.
The great textile industries of Lille and Roubaix
were robbed of their raw material, but their plant
was not seriously injured, as is shown by the fact
that in 1920 the woolen industry of these districts
was already employing 93.8 per cent and the cotton
industry 78.8 per cent of their pre&ndash;war personnel.
At Tourcoing 55 factories out of 57 were
in operation, and at Roubaix 46 out of 48.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Altogether 11,500 industrial establishments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
are said to have been interfered with, but this includes
every village workshop, and about three&ndash;quarters
of them employed less than 20 persons.
Half of them were at work again by the spring
of 1921. What is the average claim made on their
behalf? Deducting the coal mines as above and
dividing the total claim by 11,500, we reach an
average figure of nearly $35,000. The exaggeration
seems <i>prima facie</i> on as high a scale as in
the case of houses and furniture.</p>

<p>(4) The remaining item of importance is for
unbuilt&ndash;on land. The claim under this head is for
9850 million gold marks, or about $2,460,000,000.
M. Tardieu (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 347) quotes Mr. Lloyd
George as follows, in the course of a discussion
during the Peace Conference in which he was
pointing out the excessive character of the French
claims: “If you had to spend the money which
you ask for the reconstruction of the devastated
regions of the North of France, I assert that you
could not manage to spend it. Besides, the land
is still there. Although it has been badly upheaved
in parts, it has not disappeared. Even if
you put the Chemin des Dames up to auction,
you would find buyers.” Mr. Lloyd Georgeʼs
view has been justified by events. In April 1921
the French Prime Minister was able to tell his
Senate that 95 per cent of the cultivable land had
been releveled and that 90 per cent had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
plowed and was producing crops. Some go so
far as to maintain that the fertility of the soil has
been actually improved by the disturbance of its
surface and by its lying fallow for several years.
But apart from its having proved easier than was
anticipated to make good this category of damage,
the total cultivated area  (excluding woodland)
of the whole of the eleven Departments affected
was about 6,650,000 acres, of which 270,000
acres were in the “zone of destruction,” 2,000,000
acres in the “zone of trenches and bombardment,”
and 4,200,000 acres in the “zone of simple occupation.”
The claim, therefore, averaged <i>over the
whole area</i>, works out at about $370 per acre and,
averaged over the first two categories above, at
more than $1000 per acre. This claim, though it
is described as being in respect of unbuilt&ndash;on land,
probably includes farm  buildings (other than
houses), implements, live stock, and the growing
crops of August 1914. As experience has proved
that the permanent qualities of the land have only
been seriously impaired over a small area, these
latter items should probably constitute the major
part of the claim. We have also to allow for destruction
of woodlands. But even with high estimates
for each of these items, I do not see how
we could reach a total above a third of the amount
actually claimed.</p>

<p>These arguments are not exact, but they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
sufficiently so to demonstrate that the claim sent
in to the Reparation Commission is untenable. I
believe that it is at least four times the truth.
But it is possible that I have overlooked some
items of claim, and it is better in discussions of
this kind to leave a wide margin for possible error.
I assert, therefore, that on the average the claim
is not less than two or three times the truth.</p>

<p>I have spent much time over the French claim,
because it is the largest, and because more particulars
are available about it than about the
claims of the other Allies. On the face of it, the
Belgian claim is open to the same criticism as the
French. But in this claim a larger part is played
by levies on the civilian population and personal
injuries to civilians. The material damage, however,
was on a very much smaller scale than in
France. Belgian industry is already working at
its pre&ndash;war efficiency, and the amount of reconstruction
still to be made good is not on a great
scale. The Belgian Minister for Home Affairs
stated in Parliament in February 1920 that at
the date of the Armistice 80,000 houses and 1100
public buildings had been destroyed. This suggests
that the Belgian claim on this head ought
to be about a quarter of the French claim; but in
view of the greater wealth of the invaded districts
of France, the Belgian loss is probably decidedly
less than a quarter of the French loss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
The claim, actually submitted by Belgium, for
property, shipping, civilians and prisoners (that
is to say, the aggregate claim apart from pensions
and allowances) amounted to 34,254 million Belgian
francs. Inasmuch as the Belgian Ministry
of Finance, in an official survey published in 1913,
estimate the entire wealth of the country at
29,525 million Belgian francs, it is evident that,
even allowing for the diminished value of the Belgian
franc, which is our measuring rod, this claim
is very grossly excessive. I should guess that the
degree of exaggeration is quite as great as in the
case of France.</p>

<p>The British Empire claim is, apart from pensions
and allowances, almost entirely in respect
of shipping losses. The tonnage lost and damaged
is definitely known. The value of the cargoes
carried is a matter of difficult guesswork.
On the basis of an average of $150 for the hull and
$200 for the cargo per gross ton lost, I estimated
the claim in <i>The Economic Consequences of the
Peace</i> (p. 132) at $2,700,000,000. The actual
claim lodged was for $3,835,000,000. Much depends
on the date at which the cost of replacement
is calculated. Most of the tonnage was in fact
replaced out of vessels the building of which commenced
before the end of the war or shortly afterwards,
and thus cost a much higher price than
prevailed in, <i>e.g.</i>, 1921. But even so the claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
lodged is very high. It seems to be based on an
estimate of $500 per gross ton lost for hull and
cargo together, any excess in this being set off
against the fact that no separate allowance is
made for vessels damaged or molested, but not
sunk. This figure is the highest for which any
sort of plausible argument could be adduced,
rather than a judicial estimate. I adhere to the
estimate which I gave in <i>The Economic Consequences
of the Peace</i>.</p>

<p>I forbear to examine the claims of the other
Allies. The details, so far as they have been published,
are given in Appendix No. 3.</p>

<p>The observations made above relate to the
claims for material damage and do not bear on
those for pensions and allowances, which are,
nevertheless, a very large item. These latter are
to be calculated, according to the Treaty, in the
case of pensions “as being the capitalized cost at
the date of coming into force of the Treaty, on
the basis of the scales in force in France at such
date,” and in the case of allowances made during
hostilities to the dependents of mobilized persons
“on the basis of the average scale for such payments
in force in France” during each year.
That is to say, the French Army scale is to be applied
all round; and the result, given the numbers
affected, should be a calculable figure, in which
there should be little room for serious error. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>

The total would work out, therefore, at about 100

<p>What does the aggregate of the claims work
out at under all heads, and what relation does this
total bear to the final assessment of the Reparation
Commission? As the claims are stated in a
variety of national currencies, it is not quite a
simple matter to reach a total. In the following
table French francs are converted into gold marks
at 2.20 (the rate adopted by the Commission as
explained above), sterling approximately at par
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>(on the analogy of the rate for francs), Belgian
francs at the same rate as French francs, Italian
lire at twice this rate, Serbian dinars at four times
this rate, and Japanese yen at par.</p>

<p>There are omitted from this table Poland and
Czecho&ndash;Slovakia, of which the claims are probably
inadmissible, the United States, which submitted
no claim, and certain minor claimants shown in
Appendix No. 3.</p>

<p>In round figures, therefore, we may put the
claims as lodged before the Reparations Commission
at about 225 milliard gold marks, of which
95 milliards was in respect of pensions and allowances,
and 130 milliards for claims under other
heads.</p>

<p>The Reparation Commission in announcing its
decision did not particularize as between different
claimants or as between different heads of claim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and merely stated a lump sum figure. Their figure
was 132 milliards; that is to say, about 58 per
cent of the sums claimed. This decision was in
no way concerned with Germanyʼs capacity to pay,
and was simply an assessment, intended to be
judicial, as to the sum justly due under the heads
of claim established by the Treaty of Versailles.</p>

<p>The decision was unanimous, but only in face of
sharp differences of opinion. It is not suitable or
in accordance with decency to set up a body of
interested representatives to give a judicial decision
in their own case. This arrangement was
an offspring of the assumption which runs through
the Treaty that the Allies are incapable of doing
wrong, or even of partiality.</p>

<p>Nothing has been published in England about
the discussions which led up to this conclusion.
But M. Poincaré, at one time President of the
Reparation Commission and presumably well&ndash;informed
about its affairs, has lifted a corner of the
veil in an article published in the <i>Revue des Deux
Mondes</i> for May 15, 1921. He there divulges the
fact that the final result was a compromise between
the French and the British representatives,
the latter of whom endeavored to fix the figure at
104 milliards, and defended this adjudication with
skilful and even passionate advocacy.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<p>When the decision of the Reparation Commission
was first announced, and was found to abate
so largely the claims lodged with it, I hailed it,
led away a little perhaps by its very close agreement
with my own predictions, as a great triumph
for justice in international affairs. So, in a measure,
I still think it. The Reparation Commission
went a considerable way in disavowing the veracity
of the claims of the Allied Governments. Indeed,
their reduction of the claims for items other
than pensions and allowances must have been very
great since the claims for pensions, being capable
of more or less exact calculation,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> can hardly have
been subject to an initial error of anything approaching
42 per cent. If, for example, they reduced
the claim for pensions and allowances from
95 to 80 milliards, they must have reduced the
other claims from 130 milliards to 52 milliards,
that is to say, by 60 per cent. Yet even so, on
the data now available, I do not believe that their
adjudication could be maintained before an impartial
tribunal. The figure of 104 milliards, attributed
by M. Poincaré to Sir John Bradbury, is
probably the nearest we shall get to a strictly impartial
assessment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<p>To complete our summary of the facts two particulars
must be added. (1) The total, as assessed
by the Reparation Commission, comprehends the
total claim against Germany <i>and her Allies</i>. It
includes, that is to say, the damage done by the
armies of Austria&ndash;Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria,
as well as by those of Germany. Payments,
if any, made by Germanyʼs Allies must,
presumably, be deducted from the sum due. But
Annex I. of the Reparation Chapter of the Treaty
of Versailles is so drafted as to render Germany
liable for the whole amount. (2) This total is exclusive
of the sum due under the Treaty for the
reimbursement of sums lent to Belgium by her
Allies during the war. At the date of the London
Agreement (May 1921) Germanyʼs liability under
this head was provisionally estimated at 3 milliard
gold marks. But it had not then been decided
at what rate these loans, which were made
in terms of dollars, sterling, and francs, should
be converted into gold marks. The question was
referred for arbitration to Mr. Boyden, the
United States Delegate on the Reparation Commission,
and at the end of September 1921 he announced
his decision to the effect that the rate of
conversion should be based on the rate of exchange
prevailing at the date of the Armistice.
Including interest at 5 per cent, as provided by
the Treaty, I estimate that this liability amounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
at the end of 1921 to about 6 milliard gold marks,
of which slightly more than a third is due to Great
Britain and slightly less than a third each to
France and the United States respectively.</p>

<p>I take, therefore, as my final conclusion that
the best available estimate of the sum due from
Germany, under the strict letter of the Treaty of
Versailles, is 110 milliard gold marks, which may
be divided between the main categories of claim
in the proportions&mdash;74 milliards for pensions and
allowances, 30 milliards for direct damage to the
property and persons of civilians, and 6 milliards
for war debt incurred by Belgium.</p>

<p>This total is more than Germany can pay. But
the claim exclusive of pensions and allowances
should be within her capacity. The inclusion of
a demand for pensions and allowances was the
subject of a long struggle and a bitter controversy
in Paris. I have argued that those were right
who maintained that this demand was inconsistent
with the terms on which Germany surrendered
at the Armistice. I return to this subject in the
next chapter.</p>

that for some time past no one has said much

State property (with certain exceptions) in the

<p>The whole of the cash, two&ndash;thirds of the ships,

Saar coalfields, the bulk of the coal and of the

left behind by the German Army, accrued to
France. Some ships, a proportion of the coal and

Italy obtained a portion of the coal and ships and

<p>The conversion of these sums into gold marks
raises the usual controversy as to the rates at
which conversion is to be effected. The total
was estimated, however, at three milliard gold
marks,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> of which one milliard was owed to the
United States, one milliard to France, 900 millions
to Great Britain, 175 millions to Belgium, and 5
millions to Italy. On May 1, 1921, France had
about 70,000 soldiers on the Rhine, Great Britain
about 18,000, and the United States a trifling number.</p>

<p>The net result of the transitional period was,
therefore, as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Putting on one side State property transferred
to Poland, the whole of the transferable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
wealth obtained from Germany in the two and a
half years following the Armistice under all the
rigors of the Treaty, designed as they were to
extract every available liquid asset, just about
covered the costs of collection, that is to say, the
expenses of the Armies of Occupation, and left
<i>nothing</i> over for Reparation.</p>

<p>(2) But as the United States has not yet been
paid the milliard owing to her for her Army, the
other Allies have received between them on balance
a surplus of about one milliard. This surplus
was not divided amongst them equally. Great
Britain had received 450&ndash;500 million gold marks
<i>less</i> than her expenses, Belgium 300&ndash;350 million
<i>more</i> than her expenses, and France 1000&ndash;1200
millions <i>more</i> than her expenses.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Under the strict letter of the Treaty those Allies
who had received less than their share might
have claimed to be paid the difference in cash by
those who had received more. This situation and
the allocation of the milliard paid by Germany
between May and August 1921 were the subject
of the Financial Agreement provisionally signed
at Paris on August 13, 1921. This Agreement
chiefly consisted of concessions to France, partly
by Belgium, who agreed in effect to a partial postponement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of her priority charge on two milliards
out of the first sums received from Germany for
Reparation, and partly by Great Britain, who accepted
for the purposes of internal accounting
amongst the Allies themselves a lower value for
the coal delivered by Germany than the value fixed
by the Treaty.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> In view of these concessions
about future payment, the <i>first</i> milliard in cash,
received <i>after</i> May 1, 1921, was divided between
Great Britain and Belgium, the former receiving
450 million gold marks in discharge of the balance
still due to her in respect of the costs of occupation,
and the balance falling to the latter as a further
instalment of her agreed priority charge.
This Agreement was represented in the French
press as laying new burdens upon France, or at
least as withdrawing existing rights from her.
But this was not the case. The Agreement was
directed throughout to moderating the harshness
with which the letter of the Treaty and the arrangements
of Spa would have operated against
France.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>The actual value of these deliveries is a striking
example of how far the value of deliverable
articles falls below the estimates which used to be
current. The Reparation Commission have stated
that the credit which Germany will receive in respect
of her Mercantile Marine will amount to
about 755 million gold marks. This figure is low,
partly because many of the ships were disposed of
after the slump in tonnage.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Nevertheless, this
was one of the tangible assets of great value, which
it was customary at one time to invoke in answer
to those who disputed Germanyʼs capacity to make
vast payments. What does it amount to in relation
to the bill against her? The bill is 138 milliard
gold marks, on which interest at 6 per cent
for one year is 8280 million gold marks. That is
to say, Germanyʼs Mercantile Marine in its entirety,
of which the surrender humbled so much
pride and engulfed so vast an effort, would about
meet a monthʼs charges.</p>

<h3 class="p2">EXCURSUS VI</h3>

<p class="pn center">THE DIVISION OF RECEIPTS AMONGST THE ALLIES</p>

<p class="pn p1">The Allied Governments took advantage of the
Spa meeting (July 1920) to settle amongst themselves
a Reparation question which had given
much trouble in Paris and had been left unsolved<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>&mdash;namely,

receipts are to be divided between the various
Allied claimants.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The Treaty provides that the
receipts from Germany will be divided by the
Allies “in proportions which <i>have</i> been determined
upon by them in advance, on a basis of general
equity and of the rights of each.” The
failure, described by M. Tardieu, to reach an
agreement in Paris, rendered the tense of this
provision inaccurate, but at Spa it was settled as
follows:</p>

Spa Agreement.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>This settlement represented some concession on
the part of Great Britain, whose proportionate
claim was greatly increased by the inclusion of
pensions beyond what it would have been on the
basis of Reparation proper; and the proportion
claimed by Mr. Lloyd George in Paris was probably
nearer the truth (namely that the French and
British shares should be in the proportion 5 to
3). I estimate that France 45 per cent, British
Empire 33 per cent, Italy 10 per cent, Belgium
6 per cent, and the rest 6 per cent would have been
more exactly in accordance with the claims of each
under the Treaty. In view of all the facts, however,
the Spa division may be held to have done
substantial justice on the whole.</p>

<p>At the same time the priority to Belgium to the
extent of $500,000,000 was confirmed; and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
agreed that the loans made to Belgium during the
war by the other Allies, for which Germany is
liable under Article 232<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> of the Treaty, should
be dealt with out of the moneys next received.
These loans, including interest, will amount by
the end of 1921 to something in the neighborhood
of $1,500,000,000, of which $550,000,000 will be due
to Great Britain, $500,000,000 to France, and
$450,000,000 to the United States.</p>

<p>Under the Spa Agreement, therefore, sums received
from Germany in cash, and credits in respect
of deliveries in kind were to be applied to
the discharge of her obligations in the following
order:</p>

<p>1.  The cost of the Armies of Occupation, estimated
at $750,000,000 up to May 1, 1921.</p>

<p>2.  Advances to Germany for food purchases under
the Spa Agreement, say $90,000,000.</p>

<p>3.  Belgian priority of $500,000,000.</p>

<p>4.  Repayment of Allied advances to Belgium,
say $1,500,000,000.</p>

<p>This amounts to about $2,850,000,000 altogether,
of which I estimate that about $750,000,000 is due
to France, $850,000,000 to Great Britain, $550,000,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
to Belgium, and $700,000,000 to the United
States.</p>

<p>Very few people, I think, have appreciated how
large a sum is due to the United States under the
strict letter of the Agreement. Since France has
already received almost two&ndash;thirds of her share as
above, whilst Belgium has had about one&ndash;third,
Great Britain less than one&ndash;third, and the United
States nothing, it follows that, even on the most
favorable hypothesis as to Germanyʼs impending
payments, comparatively small sums are strictly
due to France in the near future.</p>

<p>The Financial Agreement of August 13, 1921,
was aimed at modifying the harshness of these
priority provisions towards France.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The details
of this Agreement have not yet been published, but
it is said to make a somewhat different provision
from that contemplated at Spa for the repayment
of Allied war advances to Belgium.</p>

<p>The reception of this Agreement by the French
public was a good illustration of the effect of
keeping people in the dark. The effect of the Spa
Agreement had never been understood in France,
with the result that the August Financial Agreement,
which much improved Franceʼs position,
was believed to interfere seriously with her existing
rights. M. Doumer never had the pluck to
tell his public the truth, although, if he had, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
would have been clear that, in signing the Agreement
provisionally, he was acting in the interests
of his country.</p>

<p>The mention of the United States invites attention
to the anomalous position of that country
under the Peace Treaty. Her failure to ratify
the Treaty forfeits none of her rights under it,
either in respect of her share of the costs of the
Army of Occupation (which, however, is offset to
a small extent by the German ships she has retained),
or in respect of the repayment of her war
advances to Belgium.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> It follows that the United
States is entitled, on the strict letter, to a considerable
part of the cash receipts from Germany
in the near future.</p>

<p>There is, however, a possible offset to these
claims which has been mentioned already (p. 78)
but must not be overlooked here. Under the
Treaty, private German property in an Allied
country is, in the case of countries adopting the
Clearing House Scheme, applied in the first instance
to debts owing from German nationals to
the nationals of the Allied country in question, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the balance, if any, is retained for Reparation.
What is to happen in the case of similar German
assets in the United States is still undetermined.
The surplus assets, the value of which may be
about $300,000,000,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> will be retained, until Congress
determines otherwise, by the Enemy Property
Custodian. There have been negotiations
from time to time for a loan in favor of Germany
on the security of these assets, but the legal position
has rendered progress impossible. At any
rate this important German asset is still under
American control.</p>

the Treaty</i>, pp. 45&ndash;55; Lamont, <i>What really happened at Paris</i>,

in his preface to M. Tardieuʼs book: “Fort en thème dʼéconomiste,
M. Keynes (qui ne fut pas seul, dans la Conférence, à
professer cette opinion) combat, sans aucun ménagement, ‘lʼabus
des exigences des Alliés’ (lisez: ‘de la France’) et de ses négociateurs....
Ces reproches et tant dʼautres dʼune violence
brutale, dont je nʼaurais rien dit, si lʼauteur, à tous risques, nʼeût
cru servir sa cause en les livrant à la publicité, font assez clairement
voir jusquʼoù certains esprits sʼétaient montés.” (In the
English edition, M. Tardieu has caused the words <i>fort en thème
dʼéconomiste</i> to be translated by the words “with some knowledge
of economics but neither imagination nor character”&mdash;which seems
rather a free rendering.)</p></div>

(<i>Reichsentschädigungskommission</i>) estimated the cost at 7228
million gold marks, also on the basis of pre&ndash;war prices; that is
to say, at about one&ndash;seventh of M. Duboisʼ estimate.</p></div>

very material. For purposes of comparison, I give M. Tardieuʼs

with approval (<i>The Times</i>, January 24, 1921) a French architect
as estimating the cost of reconstruction at an average of $2,500
per house, and quotes also, without dissent, a German estimate
that the pre&ndash;war average was $1,200. He also states, in the same
article, that the number of houses destroyed was 304,191 and the
number damaged 290,425, or 594,616 in all. Having pointed out
the importance of not overlooking sentiment in these questions,
he then multiplies $2,500, not by the number of houses but by
the number of the <i>population</i>, and arrives at an answer of
$3,750,000,000. What is one to reply to sentimental multiplication?
What is the courteous retort to controversy on these lines?
(His other figures are clearly such a mass of misprints, muddled
arithmetic, confusion between hectares and acres and the like,
that, whilst an attack could easily make a devastated area of
them, it would be unfair to base any serious criticism on this
well&ndash;intentioned farrago. As a writer on these topics, M. Brenier

1921, was that, including the above sum, Great Britain had been
repaid £5,445,000 in respect of the Spa coal advances, and had
also received, or was in course of collecting, about £43,000,000
towards the expenses of the Army of Occupation (approximately
£50,000,000). Thus, as the result of three yearsʼ Reparations,
Great Britainʼs costs of collection had been about £7,000,000

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">The Legality of the Claim for Pensions</span></p>


<p class="pn2">“The application of morals to international politics is more a
thing to be desired than a thing which has been in operation.
Also, when I am made a participant in crime along with many
millions of other people, I more or less shrug my shoulders.”&mdash;Letter
from a friendly critic to the author of <i>The Economic Consequences
of the Peace</i>.</p>


<p class="pn">We have seen in the preceding chapter that the
claim for Pensions and Allowances is nearly
double that for Devastation, so that its inclusion
in the Alliesʼ demands nearly trebles the bill. It
makes the difference between a demand which can
be met and a demand which cannot be met. Therefore
it is important.</p>

<p>In <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i> I
gave reasons for the opinion that this claim was
contrary to our engagements and an act of international
immorality. A good deal has been written
about it since then, but I cannot admit that
my conclusion has been seriously disputed. Most
American writers accept it; most French writers
ignore it; and most English writers try to show,
not that the <i>balance</i> of evidence is against me, but
that there are a few just plausible, or just not&ndash;negligible,
observations to be made on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
side. Their contention is that of the Jesuit professors
of Probabilism in the seventeenth century,
namely that the Allies are justified unless it is absolutely
certain that they are wrong, and that any
probability in their favor, however small, is
enough to save them from mortal sin.</p>

<p>But most people in the countries of Germanyʼs
former enemies are not ready to excite themselves
very much, even if my view is accepted. The passage
at the head of this chapter describes a common
attitude. International politics is a scoundrelʼs
game and always has been, and the private
citizen can scarcely feel himself personally responsible.
If our enemy breaks the rules, his action
may furnish us with an appropriate opportunity
for expressing our feelings; but this must
not be taken to commit us to a cool opinion that
such things have never happened before and must
never happen again. Sensitive and honorable patriots
do not like it, but they “more or less shrug”
their shoulders.</p>

<p>There is some common sense in this. I cannot
deny it. International morality, interpreted as
a crude legalism, might be very injurious to the
world. It is at least as true of these vast&ndash;scale
transactions, as of private affairs, that we judge
wrongly if we do not take into account <i>everything</i>.
And it is superficial to appeal, the other way
round, to the principles which do duty when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Propaganda is blistering herd emotion with its
brew of passion, sentiment, self&ndash;interest, and
moral fiddlesticks.</p>

<p>But whilst I see that nothing rare has happened
and that menʼs motives are much as usual, I do
still think that this particular act was an exceptionally
mean one, made worse by hypocritical
professions of moral purpose. My object in returning
to it is partly historical and partly practical.
New material of high interest is available
to instruct us about the course of events. And if
for practical reasons we can agree to drop this
claim, we shall make a settlement easier.</p>

<p class="p2">Those who think that it was contrary to the
Alliesʼ engagements to charge pensions against
the enemy base this opinion on the terms notified
to the German Government by President Wilson,
with the authority of the Allies, on November 5,
1918, subject to which Germany accepted the
Armistice conditions.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The contrary opinion that
the Allies were fully entitled to charge pensions
if they considered it expedient to do so, has been
supported by two distinct lines of argument: first
that the Armistice conditions of November 11,
1918, were not <i>subject</i> to President Wilsonʼs notification
of November 5, 1918, but <i>superseded</i> it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
more particularly regarding Reparation; and alternatively
that the wording of President Wilsonʼs
notification properly understood does not exclude
Pensions.</p>

<p>The first line of argument was adopted by M.
Klotz and the French Government during the
Peace Conference, and has been approved more
recently by M. Tardieu.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> It was repudiated by the
whole of the American Delegation at Paris, and
never definitely supported by the British Government.
Responsible writers about the Treaty,
other than French, have not admitted it.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It was
also explicitly abandoned by the Peace Conference
itself in its reply to the German observations
on the first draft of the Treaty. The second
line of argument was that of the British Government
during the Peace Conference, and it was
an argument on these lines which finally converted
President Wilson. I will deal with the two arguments
in turn.</p>

<p>1. Various persons have published particulars,
formerly confidential, which allow us to reconstruct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the course of the discussions about the
Armistice. These begin with the examination of
the Armistice Terms by the Allied Council of War
on November 1, 1918.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The first point which emerges is that the reply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of the Allied Governments to President Wilson
(which afterwards furnished the text of his notification
of Nov. 5, 1918, addressed to Germany),
defining their interpretation of the references to
Reparation in the Fourteen Points, was drawn up
and approved at the <i>same</i> session of the Supreme
Council (that of November 1, 2) which drew up
the relevant clauses of the Armistice Terms; and
that the Allies did not finally approve the reply
to President Wilson until <i>after</i> that they had approved
that very draft of the Armistice Terms
which, according to the French contention, superseded
and negatived the terms outlined in the
reply to President Wilson.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The record of the proceedings of the Supreme
Council (as now disclosed) lends no support to
the existence in their minds of the duplicity which
the French contention attributes to them. On the
other hand, it makes it clear that the Council did
not intend the references to Reparation in the
Armistice Terms to modify in any way their reply
to the President.</p>

<p>The record, in so far as it is relevant to this
point, may be summarized as follows:<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> M. Clemenceau
called attention to the absence of any reference
in the first draft of the Armistice Terms
to the restitution of stolen property or to reparation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Mr. Lloyd George replied that there
ought to be some reference to restitution, but that
reparation was a Peace condition rather than an
Armistice condition. M. Hymans agreed with
Mr. Lloyd George. MM. Sonnino and Orlando
went further and thought that neither had any
place in the Armistice Terms but were ready to
accept the Lloyd George&ndash;Hymans compromise of
including Restitution but not Reparation. The
discussion was postponed for M. Hymans to draft
a formula. On its resumption next day, it was
M. Clemenceau who produced a formula consisting
of the three words <i>Réparation des dommages</i>.
M. Hymans, M. Sonnino, and Mr. Bonar Law all
expressed doubt whether this was in place in the
Armistice Terms. M. Clemenceau replied that he
only wanted to mention the principle, and that
French public opinion would be surprised if there
was no reference to it. Mr. Bonar Law objected:
“It is already mentioned in our letter to
President Wilson which he is about to communicate
to Germany. It is useless to repeat it.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
This observation met with no contradiction, but
it was agreed on sentimental grounds and for the
satisfaction of public opinion to add M. Clemenceauʼs
three words. The Council then passed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
to other topics. At the last moment, as they were
about to disperse, M. Klotz slipped in the words:
“It would be prudent to put at the head of the
financial questions a clause reserving the future
claims of the Allies, and I propose to you the
wording ‘without prejudice to any subsequent
claims and demands on the part of the Allies.’”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
It does not seem to have occurred to any of those
present that this text could be deemed of material
importance or otherwise than as protecting
the Allies from the risk of being held to have surrendered
any existing claims through failure to
mention them in this document; and it was accepted
without discussion. M. Klotz afterwards
boasted that by this little device he had abolished
the Fourteen Points, so far as they affected Reparation
and Finance (although the very same meeting
of the Allies had despatched a Note to President
Wilson accepting them), and had secured to
the Allies the right to demand from Germany the
whole cost of the War. But I think the world
will decide that the Supreme Council was right
in attaching to these words no particular importance.
Personal pride in so smart a trick has led
M. Klotz, and his colleague M. Tardieu, to persist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
too long with a contention which decent persons
have now abandoned.</p>

<p>There was an episode which has lately come to
light connected with this passage which may be
recounted as illustrating the pitfalls of the world.
As M. Klotz only introduced his form of words
as the Council was breaking up, it is likely that
no undue attention was concentrated on it. But
ill&ndash;fortune may dog any one, and the same state
of affairs seems to have led to one of the scribes
getting the words down wrong. Instead of <i>revendication</i>
which means <i>demand</i>, the word <i>renonciation</i>
which means <i>concession</i> got written in the
text handed to the Germans for signature.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> This
word was not so suitable. But M. Klotz suffered
less inconvenience from this mistake than might
have been expected; since at the Peace Conference
no one noticed that the French text of the
Armistice Agreement as officially circulated, which
M. Klotz used in arguing before the Reparation
Committee, agreed in its wording with what he
had intended it to be and not with the text which
Germany had actually signed. Nevertheless it is
the word <i>renonciation</i> which is still to be found in
the official texts of the British and German Governments.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The other line of argument raises more subtle
intellectual issues and is not a mere matter of
prestidigitation. If it be granted that our rights
are governed by the terms of the Note addressed
to Germany by President Wilson in the name of
the Allies on November 5, 1918, the question depends
on the interpretation of these terms. As
Mr. Baruch and M. Tardieu have now published
between them the greater part of the official reports
(including very secret documents) bearing
on the discussion of this problem during the Peace
Conference, we are in a better position than before
to assess the value of the Alliesʼ case.</p>

<p>The pronouncements by the President which
were to form the basis of Peace provided that
there should be “no contributions” and “no punitive
damages,” but the invaded territories of Belgium,
France, Rumania, Serbia, and Montenegro
were to be restored. This did not cover losses
from submarines or from air raids. Accordingly
the Allied Governments, when they accepted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Presidentʼs formulas, embodied a reservation, on
the point as to what “restoration” covered, in
the following sentence: “By <i>it</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, restoration of
invaded territory) they understand that compensation
will be made by Germany for all damage
done to the civilian population of the Allies and
to their property by the aggression of Germany
by land, by sea, and from the air.”</p>

<p>The natural meaning and object of these words,
which, the reader must remember, are introduced
as an interpretation of the phrase “restoration
of invaded territory,” is to assimilate submarine
and cruiser aggression by sea and aeroplane and
airship aggression by air to military aggression
by land, which, in all the circumstances, was a reasonable
extension of the phrase, provided it was
duly notified beforehand. The Allies rightly apprehended
that, if they accepted the phrase as it
stood, “restoration of invaded territory” might
be limited to damage resulting from military aggression
by land.</p>

<p>This interpretation of the reservation of the
Allied Governments, namely that it assimilated
offensive action by sea or air to offensive action
by land, but that “restoration of invaded territory”
could not possibly include pensions and
separation allowances, was adopted by the American
Delegation at Paris. They construed the
German liability to be in respect of the “direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
physical damage to property of non&ndash;military character
and direct physical injury to civilians”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
caused by such aggression; the only further liability
which they admitted being under a different
part of the Presidentʼs pronouncements,
namely, those relating to breaches of International
law, such as the breach of the Treaty of Neutrality
in favor of Belgium, and the illegal treatment
of prisoners of war.</p>

<p>I doubt if any one would ever have challenged
this interpretation if the British Prime Minister
had not won a General Election by promises to
extract from Germany more than this interpretation
could justify,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and if the French Government
also had not raised unjustifiable expectations.
These promises were made recklessly. But it was
not easy for their authors to admit, so soon after
they had been given, that they were contrary to
our engagements.</p>

<p>The discussion opened with the delegations,
other than the American, claiming that we had not
committed ourselves to anything which precluded
our demanding from Germany all the loss and
damage, direct and indirect, which had resulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
from the war. “One of the Allies,” says Mr.
Baruch, “went even further, and made claim for
loss and damage resulting from the fact that the
Armistice was concluded so unexpectedly that the
termination of hostilities involved it in financial
losses.”</p>

<p>Various arguments were employed in the early
stages, the British delegates to the Reparation
Committee of the Peace Conference, namely, Mr.
Hughes, Lord Sumner and Lord Cunliffe, supporting
the demand for complete war costs and
not merely reparation for damage. They urged
(1) that one of the principles enunciated by President
Wilson was that each item of the Treaty
should be just, and that it was in accordance with
the general principles of justice to throw on Germany
the whole costs of the war; and (2) that
Great Britainʼs war costs had resulted from Germanyʼs
breach of the Treaty of Neutrality of Belgium,
and that therefore Great Britain (but not
necessarily, on this argument, all the other Allies)
was entitled to complete repayment in accordance
with the general principles of International
law. These general arguments were, I
think, overwhelmed by the speeches made on behalf
of the American delegates by Mr. John Foster
Dulles. The following are extracts from what
he said: “If it is in accordance with our sentiment
that the principles of reparation be severe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
and in accord with our material interest that these
principles be all inclusive, why, in defiance of these
motives, have we proposed reparation in certain
limited ways only? It is because, gentlemen, we
do not regard ourselves as free. We are not
here to consider as a novel proposal what reparation
the enemy should in justice pay; we have
not before us a blank page upon which we are free
to write what we will. We have before us a page,
it is true; but one which is already filled with
writing, and at the bottom are the signatures of
Mr. Wilson, of Mr. Orlando, of M. Clemenceau,
and of Mr. Lloyd George. You are all aware, I
am sure, of the writing to which I refer: it is the
agreed basis of peace with Germany.” Mr.
Dulles then recapitulated the relevant passages
and continued: “Can there be any question that
this agreement does constitute a limitation? It
is perfectly obvious that it was recognized at the
time of the negotiations in October and November
1918 that the reparation then specified for
would limit the Associated Governments as to the
reparation which they could demand of the enemy
as a condition of peace. The whole purpose of
Germany was to ascertain the maximum which
would be demanded of her in the terms of peace,
and the action of the Allies in especially stipulating
at that time, for an enlargement of the original
proposal respecting reparation is explicable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
only on the theory that it was understood that
once an agreement was concluded they would no
longer be free to specify the reparation which
Germany must make. We have thus agreed that
we would give Germany peace if she would do
certain specified things. Is it now open to us to
say, ‘Yes, but before you get peace you must do
other and further things’? We have said to Germany,
‘You may have peace if among other things
you perform certain acts of reparation which will
cost you, say, ten million dollars.’ Are we not
now clearly precluded from saying, ‘You can have
peace provided you perform other acts of reparation
which will bring your total liability to many
times that which was originally stipulated’? No;
irrespective of the justice of the enemy making
the latter reparation, it is now too late. Our bargain
has been struck for better or for worse; it
remains only to give it a fair construction and
practical application.”</p>

<p>It is a shameful memory that the British delegates
never withdrew their full demands, to which
they were still adhering when, in March 1921, the
question was taken out of their hands by the Supreme
Council. The American Delegation cabled
to the President, who was then at sea, for support
in maintaining their position, to which he replied
that the American Delegation should dissent, and
if necessary dissent publicly, from a procedure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
which “is clearly inconsistent with what we deliberately
led the enemy to expect and cannot now
honorably alter simply because we have the
power.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>After this the discussions entered on a new
phase. The British and French Prime Ministers
abandoned the contentions of their delegates, admitted
the binding force of the words contained
in their Note of November 5, 1918, and settled
down to extract some meaning from these words
which would compose their differences and satisfy
their constituents. What constituted “damage
done to the civilian population”? Could not this
be made to cover military pensions and the separation
allowances which had been made to the
civilian dependents of soldiers? If so, the bill
against Germany could be raised to a high enough
figure to satisfy nearly every one. It was pointed
out, however, as Mr. Baruch records, “that financial
loss resulting from the absence of a wage&ndash;earner
did not cause any more ‘damage to the
civilian population’ than did an equal financial
loss involved in the payment of taxes to provide
military equipment and like war costs.” In fact,
a separation allowance or a pension was simply
one of many general charges on the Exchequer
arising out of the costs of the war. If such
charges were to be admitted as civilian damage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
it was a very short step back to the claim for the
entire costs of the war, on the ground that these
costs must fall on the taxpayer who, generally
speaking, was a civilian. The sophistry of the
argument became exposed by pushing it to its logical
conclusion. Nor was it clear how pensions
and allowances could be covered by words which
were themselves an interpretation of the phrase,
“restoration of invaded territory.” And the
Presidentʼs conscience, though very desirous by
now to be converted (for he had on hand other
controversies with his colleagues which interested
him more than this one) remained unconvinced.</p>

<p>The American delegates have recorded that the
final argument which overbore the last scruples
of the President was contained in a Memorandum
prepared by General Smuts<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> on March 31, 1919.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Briefly, this argument was, that a soldier becomes
a civilian again after his discharge, and that,
therefore, a wound, the effects of which persist
after he has left the Army, is damage done to a
civilian.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> This is the argument by which “damage
done to the civilian population” came to include
damage done to soldiers. This is the
argument on which, in the end, our case was based!
For at this straw the Presidentʼs conscience
clutched, and the matter was settled.</p>

<p>It had been settled in the privacy of the Four.
I will give the final scene in the words of Mr.
Lamont, one of the American delegates:<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p class="pn3">“I well remember the day upon which
President Wilson determined to support the
inclusion of pensions in the Reparation Bill.
Some of us were gathered in his library in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the Place des États Unis, having been summoned
by him to discuss this particular question
of pensions. We explained to him that
we couldnʼt find a single lawyer in the American
Delegation that would give an opinion in
favor of including pensions. All the logic
was against it. ‘Logic! logic!’ exclaimed the
President, ‘I donʼt care a damn for logic. I
am going to include pensions!’”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Well! perhaps I was too near these things at
the time and have become touched in the emotions,
but I cannot “more or less shrug my shoulders.”
Whether or not that is the appropriate
gesture, I have here set forth, for the inspection
of Englishmen and our Allies, the moral basis on
which two&ndash;thirds of our claims against Germany
rest.</p>

judgment as follows (vol. ii., p. 43): “It is this statement

must be taken as the ruling document in any discussion as to
what the Allies were entitled to claim by way of reparation in

<p class="pf"><a name="Footnote_96_96" id="Footnote_96_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96_96"><span class="label">[96]</span></a> The following particulars are taken from <i>Les Négociations
Secrètes et les Quatre Armistices avec pièces justificatives</i> by
“Mermeix,” published at Paris by Ollendorff, 1921. This remarkable
volume has not received the attention it deserves. The
greater part of it consists of a verbatim transcript of the secret
<i>Procès Verbaux</i> of those meetings of the Supreme Council of the
Allies which were concerned with the Armistice Terms. On the
face of it this disclosure is authentic and is corroborated in part
by M. Tardieu. There are many passages of extraordinary interest
on points not connected with my present topic, as for
example the discussion of the question whether the Allies should
insist on the surrender of the German fleet if the Germans made
trouble about it. Marshal Foch emerges from this record very
honorably, as determined that nothing unnecessary should be demanded
of the enemy, and that no blood should be spilt for a
vain or trifling object. Sir Douglas Haig was of the same opinion.
In reply to Col. House, Foch spoke thus: “If they accept the
terms of the Armistice we are imposing on them, it is a capitulation.
Such a capitulation gives us everything we could get from
the greatest victory. In such circumstances I cannot admit that
I have the right to risk the life of a single man more.” And
again on October 31: “If our conditions are accepted we can wish
for nothing better. We make war only to attain our ends, and
we do not want to prolong it uselessly.” In reply to a proposal
by Mr. Balfour that the Germans in evacuating the East should
leave one&ndash;third of their arms behind them, Foch observed: “The
intrusion of all these clauses makes our document chimerical,
since the greater part of the conditions are incapable of being
executed. We should do well to be sparing with these unrealizable
injunctions.” Towards Austria also he was humane and feared
the prolongation of the blockade which the politicians were proposing.
“I intervene,” he said on October 31, 1918, “in a matter
which is not a military one strictly speaking. We are to maintain
the blockade until Peace, that is to say until we have made
a new Austria. That may take a long time; which means a
country condemned to famine and perhaps impelled to anarchy.”</p></div>

it makes no material difference to the argument whether the text

for I regard either form of words as merely a protective
phrase. But the plausibility of M. Klotzʼs position is decidedly
weakened (if so weak a case is capable of further weakening) if
it is the latter phrase which is authentic. The Editor of the
Institute of International Affairs’ <i>History of the Peace Conference
of Paris</i>, who was the first to discover and publish the
discrepancy in question (vol. v., pp. 370&ndash;372), takes the view that
the question of which text is used makes a material difference to
the value of M. Klotzʼs argument.</p></div>

the accompanying circumstances which, without justifying its
arguments (on which indeed no further light could be thrown
beyond what we already have in the narrative of Mr. Baruch),
might yet throw light on individual motives. I agree with the
comment made by <i>The Economist</i> (Oct. 22, 1921) in reviewing
Vol. IV. of the <i>History of the Peace Conference of Paris</i> (published
under the auspices of the Institute of International Affairs),
which has reprinted this Memorandum, that “a very serious
injustice will be done to the reputation of General Smuts if
this document continues to be reproduced and circulated without
any explanation of the circumstances in which it was prepared.”
Nevertheless it is well that the world should have this document,
and it must take its place in a story which is more important to
the world than the motives and reputations of individual actors
in it.</p></div>

<p class="pf"><a name="Footnote_107_107" id="Footnote_107_107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_107_107"><span class="label">[107]</span></a> The following is the salient passage of the Memorandum:
“After the soldierʼs discharge as unfit he rejoins the civilian
population, and as for the future he cannot (in whole or in part)
earn his own livelihood, he is suffering damage as a member of
the civilian population, for which the German Government are
again liable to make compensation. In other words, the pension
for disablement which he draws from the French Government is
really a liability of the German Government, which they must
under the above reservation make good to the French Government.
It could not be argued that as he was disabled while a
soldier he does not suffer damage as a civilian after his discharge
if he is unfit to do his ordinary work. He does literally suffer as
civilian after his discharge, and his pension is intended to make
good this damage, and is therefore a liability of the German
Government.”</p></div>

simply an impatience of technicality; a determination to brush
aside verbiage and get at the root of things. There was not one
of us in the room whose heart did not beat with a like feeling.”
These words not merely reflect a little naïvely the modern opportunistʼs
impatience of legality and respect for the <i>fait accompli</i>,
but also recall the atmosphere of exhaustion and the longing of
everyone to be finished, somehow, with this dreadful controversy,
which for months had outraged at the same time the intellects
and the consciences of most of the participators. Yet, even so,
to their lasting credit, the American Delegation had stood firm
for the law, and it was the President, and he alone, who capitulated
to the lying exigencies of politics.</p></div></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Reparation, Inter&ndash;Ally Debt, and
International Trade</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">It is fashionable at the present time to urge a
reduction of the Alliesʼ claims on Germany and
of Americaʼs claims on the Allies, on the ground
that, as such payments can only be made in goods,
insistence on these claims will be positively injurious
to the claimants.</p>

<p>That it is in the self&ndash;interest of the Allies and
of America to abate their respective demands, I
hold to be true. But it is better not to use bad
arguments, and the suggestion that it is necessarily
injurious to receive goods for nothing is
not plausible or correct. I seek in this chapter
to disentangle the true from the false in the now
popular belief that there is something harmful
in compelling Germany (or Europe) to “fling
goods at us.”</p>

<p>The argument is a little intricate and the
reader must be patient.</p>

<p>1. It does not make very much difference
whether the debtor country pays by sending goods
direct to the creditor or by selling them elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and remitting cash. In either case the goods come
on to the world market and are sold competitively
or coöperatively in relation to the industries of
the creditor, as the case may be, this distinction
depending on the nature of the goods rather than
on the market in which they are sold.</p>

<p>2. It is not much use to <i>earmark</i> non&ndash;competitive
goods against the payment of the debt, so
long as competitive goods are being sold by the
debtor country in some other connection, <i>e.g.</i>, to
pay for its own imports. This is simply to bury
oneʼs head in the sand. For example, out of the
aggregate of goods which Germany would naturally
export in the event of her exports being
forcibly stimulated, it might be possible to pick
out a selection of non&ndash;competitive goods; but it
would not affect the situation in the slightest degree
to pretend that it was these particular goods,
and not the others, which were paying the debt.
It is therefore useless to prescribe that Germany
shall pay in certain specified commodities if these
are commodities which she would export in any
case, and useless, equally, to forbid her to pay in
certain specified commodities, if that merely
means that she will export these commodities to
some other market to pay for her imports generally.
No expedient on our part for making Germany
pay us, or on Americaʼs part for making us
pay her, in the shape of particular commodities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
affects the position, except in so far as it modifies
the form of the paying countryʼs exports <i>as a
whole</i>.</p>

<p>3. On the other hand, it does us no harm to receive
for nothing the proceeds of goods, even when
they are sold competitively, if these goods would
be sold on the worldʼs market in any case.</p>

<p>4.  If the result of pressing the debtor country
to pay is to cause it to offer competitive goods
at a lower price than it would otherwise, the particular
industries in the creditor country which
produce these goods are bound to suffer, even
though there are balancing advantages for the
creditor country as a whole.</p>

<p>5. In so far as the payments made by the debtor
country accrue, not to the country with which the
debtorʼs goods are competing, but to a third party,
clearly there are no balancing advantages to offset
the direct disadvantages under 4.</p>

<p>6. The answer to the question, whether the balancing
advantages to the creditor country as a
whole outweigh the injury to particular industries
within that country, depends on the length of the
period over which the creditor country can reasonably
expect to go on receiving the payments.
At first the injury to the industries which suffer
from the competition and to those employed in
them is likely to outweigh the benefit of the payments
received. But, as in the course of time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
capital and labor are absorbed in other directions,
a balance of advantage may accrue.</p>

<p>The application of these general principles to
the particular case of ourselves and Germany is
easy. Germanyʼs exports are so preponderantly
competitive with ours, that, if her exports are
forcibly stimulated, it is certain that she will have
to sell goods against us. This is not altered by
the fact that it is possible to pick out a few exports
or potential exports, such as potash or
sugar, which are not competitive. If Germany is
to have a <i>large</i> surplus of exports over imports,
she must increase her competitive sales. In the
<i>Economic Consequences of the Peace</i> (pp. 175&ndash;185)
I demonstrated this at some length on the
basis of pre&ndash;war statistics. I showed not only
that the goods she must sell, but the markets she
must sell them in, were largely competitive with
our own. The statistics of post&ndash;war trade show
that the former argument still holds good. The
following table shows the proportions in which
her export trade was divided between the principal
articles of export, (1) in 1913, (2) in the
first nine months of 1920 (the latest period for
which I have figures in this precise form), and
(3) in the four months June to September 1921,
these last figures representing, I think, a not exactly
comparable classification, and being provisional
only:</p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that, though raw materials
other than coal, such as potash, sugar, and
timber may yield a trifle, Germany can only compass
an export trade of great value by exporting
iron and steel goods, chemicals, dyes, textiles, and
coal, for these are the only export articles of
which she can produce great quantities. It is also
clear that there have been no very marked
changes in the proportionate importance of the
different export trades since the war, except that
the exchange position has somewhat stimulated,
relatively to the others, those export lines, such
as iron goods, machinery, chemicals, dyes, and
glass, which do not involve much importation of
raw materials.</p>

<p>To compel Germany to pay a large indemnity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
is therefore the same thing as to compel her to
expand some or all of the above&ndash;mentioned exports
to a greater extent than she would do otherwise.
The only way in which she can effect this
expansion is by offering the goods at a lower price
than that at which other countries care to offer
them; putting herself in a position to offer them
cheap, partly by the German working classes lowering
their standard of life without reducing
their efficiency in the same degree, and partly by
German <i>export</i> industries being subsidized, directly
or indirectly, at the expense of the rest of
the community.</p>

<p>These facts, formerly overlooked, are now, perhaps,
exaggerated by popular opinion. For Principle
(3), enunciated above, requires attention.
Our industries will be subjected to strong competition
from Germany, just as they were before the
war, whether we exact Reparation or not; and
we must not ascribe to the Reparation policy inconveniences
which would exist in any case. The
remedy lies not in the now popular nostrums for
prescribing the <i>form</i> in which Germany shall pay,
but in reducing the aggregate <i>amount</i> to a reasonable
figure. For by prescribing the manner in
which she shall pay <i>us</i> we do not control the form
of her export trade as a whole; and by absorbing
for reparation purposes the whole of a particular
type of export, we compel her to expand her other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
exports to pay for her imports and other international
obligations. On the other hand, we can
secure from her moderate payments, on the sort
of scale, for example, on which she might have
been building up new foreign investments, without
stimulating her exports as a whole to a greater
activity than they would enjoy otherwise. This
is the correct course for Great Britain from the
standpoint of her own self&ndash;interest only.</p>

<p>The practical application of Principles (5) and
(6) is also clear. So far as (5) is concerned,
Great Britain is to receive not the whole of the
indemnity, but about a fifth of it; whilst (6) provides
the argument which to me has always appeared
decisive. The <i>permanence</i> of reparation
payments on a large scale for a long period of
years is, to say the least, not to be reckoned on.
Who believes that the Allies will, over a period
of one or two generations, exert adequate force
over the German Government, or that the German
Government can exert adequate authority
over its subjects, to extract continuing fruits on
a vast scale from forced labor? No one believes
it in his heart; no one at all. There is not the
faintest possibility of our persisting with this
affair to the end. But if this is so, then, most
certainly, it will not be worth our while to disorder
our export trades and disturb the equilibrium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of our industry for two or three years;
much less to endanger the peace of Europe.</p>

<p>The same principles apply with one modification
to the United States and to the exaction by
her of the debts which the Allied Governments
owe. The industries of the United States would
suffer, not so much from the competition of cheap
goods from the Allies in their endeavors to pay
their debts, as from the inability of the Allies to
purchase from America their usual proportion of
her exports. The Allies would have to find the
money to pay America, not so much by selling
more as by buying less. The farmers of the
United States would suffer more than the manufacturers;
if only because increased imports can
be kept out by a tariff, whilst there is no such
easy way of stimulating diminished exports. It
is, however, a curious fact that whilst Wall Street
and the manufacturing East are prepared to consider
a modification of the debts, the Middle West
and South is reported (I write ignorantly) to be
dead against it. For two years Germany was
not required to pay cash to the Allies, and during
that period the manufacturers of Great Britain
were quite blind to what the consequences would
be to themselves when the payments actually
began. The Allies have not yet been required
to begin to pay cash to the United States, and the
farmers of the latter are still as blind as were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the British manufacturers to the injuries they
will suffer if the Allies ever try seriously to pay
in full. I recommend Senators and Congressmen
from the agricultural districts of the United
States, lest they soon suffer the same moral and
intellectual ignominy as our own high&ndash;Reparation
men, to invest at once in a little caution in
their opposition to the efforts of Mr. Hardingʼs
Administration to secure for itself a free hand
to act wisely in this matter (and even perhaps
generously) in accordance with the progress of
opinion and of events.</p>

<p>The decisive argument, however, for the United
States, as for Great Britain, is not the damage
to particular interests (which would diminish with
time), but the unlikelihood of permanence in the
exaction of the debts, even if they were paid for
a short period. I say this, not only because I
doubt the ability of the European Allies to pay,
but because of the great difficulty of the problem
which the United States has before her in any case
in balancing her commercial account with the Old
World.</p>

<p>American economists have examined somewhat
carefully the statistical measure of the change
from the pre&ndash;war position. According to their
estimates, America is now owed more interest on
foreign investments than is due from her, quite
apart from the interest on the debts of the Allied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Governments; and her mercantile marine now
earns from foreigners more than she owes them
for similar services. Her excess of exports of
commodities over imports approaches $3000 millions
a year;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> whilst, on the other side of the balance,
payments, mainly to Europe, in respect of
tourists and of immigrant remittances are estimated
at not above $1000 millions a year. Thus,
in order to balance the account as it now stands,
the United States must lend to the rest of the
world, in one shape or another, not less than
$2000 millions a year, to which interest and sinking
fund on the European Governmental War
Debts would, if they were paid, add about $600
millions.</p>

<p>Recently, therefore, the United States must
have been lending to the rest of the world, mainly
Europe, something like $2000 millions a year.
Fortunately for Europe, a fair proportion of this
was by way of speculative purchases of depreciated
paper currencies. From 1919 to 1921 the
losses of American speculators fed Europe; but
this source of income can scarcely be reckoned
on permanently. For a time the policy of loans
can meet the situation; but, as the interest on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
past loans mounts up, it must in the long run
aggravate it.</p>

<p>Mercantile nations have always employed large
funds in overseas trade. But the practice of foreign
investment, as we know it now, is a very
modern contrivance, a very unstable one, and only
suited to peculiar circumstances. An old country
can in this way develop a new one at a time
when the latter could not possibly do so with its
own resources alone; the arrangement may be
mutually advantageous, and out of abundant
profits the lender may hope to be repaid. But
the position cannot be reversed. If European
bonds are issued in America on the analogy of
the American bonds issued in Europe during the
nineteenth century, the analogy will be a false
one; because, taken in the aggregate, there is no
natural increase, no <i>real</i> sinking fund, out of
which they can be repaid. The interest will be
furnished out of new loans, so long as these are
obtainable, and the financial structure will mount
always higher, until it is not worth while to maintain
any longer the illusion that it has foundations.
The unwillingness of American investors
to buy European bonds is based on common sense.</p>

<p>At the end of 1919 I advocated (in <i>The Economic
Consequences of the Peace</i>) a reconstruction
loan from America to Europe, conditioned,
however, on Europeʼs putting her own house in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
order. In the past two years America, in spite
of European complaints to the contrary, has, in
fact, made <i>very large</i> loans, much larger than the
sum I contemplated, though not mainly in the
form of regular, dollar&ndash;bond issues. No particular
conditions were attached to these loans, and
much of the money has been lost. Though wasted
in part, they have helped Europe through the critical
days of the post&ndash;Armistice period. But a
continuance of them cannot provide a solution
for the existing disequilibrium in the balance of
indebtedness.</p>

<p>In part the adjustment may be effected by the
United States taking the place hitherto held by
England, France, and (on a small scale) Germany
in providing capital for those new parts of the
world less developed than herself&mdash;the British
Dominions and South America. The Russian Empire,
too, in Europe and Asia, may be regarded
as virgin soil, which will at a later date provide
a suitable outlet for foreign capital. The American
investor will lend more wisely to these countries,
on the lines on which British and French investors
used to lend to them, than direct to the
old countries of Europe. But it is not likely that
the whole gap can be bridged thus. Ultimately,
and probably soon, there must be a readjustment
of the balance of exports and imports. America
must buy more and sell less. This is the only alternative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
to her making to Europe an annual present.
Either American prices must rise faster
than European (which will be the case if the Federal
Reserve Board allows the gold influx to produce
its natural consequences), or, failing this,
the same result must be brought about by a further
depreciation of the European exchanges,
until Europe, by inability to buy, has reduced her
purchases to articles of necessity. At first the
American exporter, unable to scrap all at once
the processes of production for export, may meet
the situation by lowering his prices; but when
these have continued, say for two years, below
his cost of production, he will be driven inevitably
to curtail or abandon his business.</p>

<p>It is useless for the United States to suppose
that an equilibrium position can be reached on
the basis of her exporting at least as much as at
present, and at the same time restricting her imports
by a tariff. Just as the Allies demand vast
payments from Germany, and then exercise their
ingenuity to prevent her paying them, so the
American Administration devises, with one hand,
schemes for financing exports, and, with the other,
tariffs which will make it as difficult as possible
for such credits to be repaid. Great nations can
often act with a degree of folly which we should
not excuse in an individual.</p>

<p>By the shipment to the United States of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
bullion in the world, and the erection there of a
sky&ndash;scraping golden calf, a short postponement
may be gained. But a point may even come when
the United States will refuse gold, yet still demand
to be paid,&mdash;a new Midas vainly asking
more succulent fare than the barren metal of her
own contract.</p>

<p>In any case the readjustment will be severe,
and injurious to important interests. If, in addition,
the United States exacts payment of the
Allied debts, the position will be intolerable. If
she persevered to the bitter end, scrapped her
export industries and diverted to other uses the
capital now employed in them, and if her former
European associates decided to meet their obligations
at whatever cost to themselves, I do not
deny that the final result might be to Americaʼs
material interest. But the project is utterly chimerical.
It will not happen. Nothing is more
certain than that America will not pursue such a
policy to its conclusion; she will abandon it as
soon as she experiences its first consequences.
Nor, if she did, would the Allies pay the money.
The position is exactly parallel to that of German
Reparation. America will not carry through to
a conclusion the collection of Allied debt, any
more than the Allies will carry through the collection
of their present Reparation demands.
Neither, in the long run, is serious politics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Nearly all well&ndash;informed persons admit this in
private conversation. But we live in a curious
age when utterances in the press are deliberately
designed to be in conformity with the worst&ndash;informed,
instead of with the best&ndash;informed, opinion,
because the former is the wider spread; so
that for comparatively long periods there can be
discrepancies, laughable or monstrous, between
the written and the spoken word.</p>

<p>If this is so, it is not good business for America
to embitter her relations with Europe, and to disorder
her export industries for two years, in pursuance
of a policy which she is certain to abandon
before it has profited her.</p>

<p>For the benefit of any reader who enjoys an
abstract statement, I summarize the argument
thus. The equilibrium of international trade is
based on a complicated balance between the agriculture
and the industries of the different countries
of the world, and on a specialization by each
in the employment of its labor and its capital. If
one country is required to transfer to another
without payment great quantities of goods, for
which this equilibrium does not allow, the balance
is destroyed. Since capital and labor are
fixed and organized in certain employments and
cannot flow freely into others, the disturbance of
the balance is destructive to the utility of the capital
and labor thus fixed. The <i>organization</i>, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
which the wealth of the modern world so largely
depends, suffers injury. In course of time a new
organization and a new equilibrium can be established.
But if the origin of the disturbance is of
temporary duration, the losses from the injury
done to organization may outweigh the profit of
receiving goods without paying for them. Moreover,
since the losses will be concentrated on the
capital and labor employed in particular industries,
they will provoke an outcry out of proportion
to the injury inflicted on the community as
a whole.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">The Revision of the Treaty and the
Settlement of Europe</span></p>


<p class="pn p2">The deeper and the fouler the bogs into which
Mr. Lloyd George leads us, the more credit is his
for getting us out. He leads us in to satisfy our
desires; he leads us out to save our souls. He
hands us down the primrose path and puts out
the bonfire just in time. Who, ever before, enjoyed
the best of heaven and hell as we do?</p>

<p>In England, opinion has nearly completed its
swing, and the Prime Minister is making ready
to win a General Election on Forbidding Germany
to Pay, Employment for Every one, and a
Happier Europe for All. Why not, indeed? But
this Faustus of ours shakes too quickly his
kaleidoscope of halos and hell&ndash;fire, for me to depict
the hues as they melt into one another. I
shall do better to construct an independent solution,
which is <i>possible</i> in the sense that nothing
but a change in the popular will is necessary to
achieve it, hoping to influence this will a little,
but leaving it to those, whose business it is, to
gage the moment at which it will be safe to
embroider such patterns on a political banner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>If I look back two years and read again what I
wrote then, I see that perils which were ahead are
now passed safely. The patience of the common
people of Europe and the stability of its institutions
have survived the worst shocks they will
receive. Two years ago the Treaty, which outraged
Justice, Mercy, and Wisdom, represented
the momentary will of the victorious countries.
Would the victims be patient? Or would they be
driven by despair and privation to shake Societyʼs
foundations? We have the answer now. They
have been patient. Nothing very much has happened,
except pain and injury to individuals. The
communities of Europe are settling down to a new
equilibrium. We are almost ready to turn our
minds from the avoidance of calamity to the renewal
of health.</p>

<p>There have been other influences besides that
patience of the common people which often before
has helped Europe through worse evils. The actions
of those in power have been wiser than their
words. It is only a slight exaggeration to say
that no parts of the Peace Treaties have been carried
out, except those relating to frontiers and to
disarmament. Many of the misfortunes which I
predicted as attendant on the execution of the
Reparation Chapter have not occurred, because no
serious attempt has been made to execute it. And,
whilst no one can predict with what particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
sauce the makers of the Treaty will eat their
words, there can no longer be any question of the
actual enforcement of this Chapter. And there
has been a third factor, not quite in accordance
with expectations, paradoxical at first sight, but
natural, nevertheless, and concordant with past
experience,&mdash;the fact that it is in times of growing
profits and not in times of growing distress
that the working classes stir themselves and
threaten their masters. When times are bad and
poverty presses on them they sink back again into
a weary acquiescence. Great Britain and all Europe
have learned this in 1921. Was not the
French Revolution rather due perhaps to the
growing wealth of eighteenth&ndash;century France&mdash;for
at that time France was the richest country
in the world&mdash;than to the pressure of taxation or
the exactions of the old régime? It is the
profiteer, not privation, that makes man shake his
chains.</p>

<p>In spite, therefore, of trade depression and disordered
exchanges, Europe, under the surface, is
much stabler and much healthier than two years
ago. The disturbance of minds is less. The organization,
destroyed by war, has been partly restored;
transport, except in Eastern Europe, is
largely repaired; there has been a good harvest,
everywhere but in Russia, and raw materials are
abundant. Great Britain and the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and their markets overseas have suffered a cyclical
fluctuation of trade prosperity of a greater amplitude
than ever before; but there are indications
that the worst point is passed.</p>

<p>Two obstacles remain. The Treaty, though unexecuted,
is not revised. And that part of organization,
which consists in currency regulation,
public finance, and the foreign exchanges, remains
nearly as bad as it ever was. In most European
countries there is still no proper balance between
the expenditure of the State and its income, so
that inflation continues and the international values
of their currencies are fluctuating and uncertain.
The suggestions which follow are mainly
directed towards these problems.</p>

<p class="p2">Some contemporary plans for the reconstruction
of Europe err in being too paternal or too
complicated; also, sometimes, in being too pessimistic.
The patients need neither drugs nor
surgery, but healthy and natural surroundings in
which they can exert their own recuperative
powers. Therefore a good plan must be in the
main <i>negative</i>; it must consist in getting rid of
shackles, in simplifying the situation, in canceling
futile but injurious entanglements. At present
every one is faced by obligations which they
cannot meet. Until the problem set to the Finance
Ministers of Europe is a <i>possible</i> one, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
can be little incentive to energy or to the exercise
of skill. But if the situation was made such
that an insolvent country could have only itself
to blame, then the highest integrity and the most
accomplished financial technique would, in each
separate country, have its chance. I seek by the
proposals of this chapter, not to prescribe a solution,
but to create a situation in which a solution
is possible.</p>

<p>In their main substance, therefore, my suggestions
are not novel. The now familiar project
of the cancelation, in part or in their entirety, of
the Reparation and Inter&ndash;allied Debts, is a large
and unavoidable feature of them. But those who
are not prepared for these measures must not
pretend to a serious interest in the Reconstruction
of Europe.</p>

<p>In so far as such cancelation or abatement involves
concessions by Great Britain, an Englishman
can write without embarrassment and with
some knowledge of the tendency of popular opinion
in his own country. But where concessions by
the United States are concerned he is in more difficulty.
The attitude of a section of the American
press furnishes an almost irresistible temptation
to deal out the sort of humbug (or discrete
half&ndash;truths) which are believed to promote cordiality
between nations; it is easy and terribly
respectable; and what is much worse, it may even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
do good where frankness would do harm. I pursue
the opposite course, with a doubting and uneasy
conscience, yet supported (not only in this
chapter but throughout my book) by the hope,
possibly superstitious, that openness does good
in the long run, even when it makes trouble at
first.</p>

<p>So far, Reparation on a large scale has not been
collected from Germany. So far, the Allies have
not paid interest to the United States on what
they owe. Our present troubles, when they are
not attributable to the after&ndash;effects of war and
the cyclical depression of trade, are due, therefore,
not to the enforcement of these claims, but to the
uncertainties of their possible enforcement. It
follows, therefore, that merely to put off the problem
will do us no good. That is what we have
been doing for two years already. Even to reduce
our Reparation demands to Germanyʼs maximum
actual capacity and really force her to pay
them, might make matters worse than they are.
To write down inter&ndash;ally debts by half and then
try to collect them, would be an aggravation, not
a cure, of the existing difficulties. The solution,
therefore, must not be one which tries to extract
the last theoretical penny from everybody; its
main object must be to set the Finance Ministers
of <i>every</i> country a problem not incapable of wise
solution over the next five years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 pn center">I. <i>The Revision of the Treaty</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">The Reparation Commission have assessed the
Treaty claims at 138 milliard gold marks, of which
132 milliards are for pensions and damage and 6
milliards for Belgian debt. They have not stated
in what proportions the 132 milliards are divided
between pensions and damages. My own assessment
of the Treaty claims (p. 131 above) is 110
milliards, of which 74 milliards are for pensions
and allowances, 30 milliards for damage and 6
milliards for Belgian debt.</p>

<p>The arguments of Chapter VI make it incumbent
on those who are convinced by them to abandon
as dishonorable the claims to pensions and
allowances. This reduces the claims to 36 milliards,
a sum which it may not be in our interest
to exact in full, but which is probably within Germanyʼs
theoretical capacity to pay.</p>

<p>Apart from clearing out of the way various
clauses which are no longer operative or useful,
and from terminating the occupation on conditions
set forth below, I should limit my Revision
of the Treaty to this simple stroke of the pen.
Let the present assessment of 138 milliard gold
marks be replaced by 36 milliard gold marks.</p>

<p>We are strictly entitled under the Armistice
Terms to these 36 milliards; and if prudence
recommends an abatement below that figure, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
abatement can properly be made, on terms, by
those and those only who are entitled to the claims.
I estimate with some confidence that this sum of
36 milliards is divisible between the Allies about
in the proportions shown in the table below.</p>

<p>The payment by Germany of 5 per cent interest
and 1 per cent sinking fund on this total sum
is not, in my judgment, theoretically impossible.
But it could only be done by stimulating her export
industries in a manner injurious and irritating
to Great Britain, and by imposing on her
Treasury a financial problem of such difficulty
that it would tend to unsound finance and to weak,
unstable Governments. Even though this payment
is theoretically possible, I do not think that
it is practically obtainable over a period of thirty
years.</p>

<p>I recommend, therefore, that, as a separate arrangement
from the Revision of the Treaty as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
above, the British Empire should waive the whole
of their claims, with the exception of 1 milliard
gold marks reserved for a special purpose explained
below, and should undertake to square
the claims of Italy and the minor claimants by
cancelation of debt owing from them; thus leaving
Germany to pay 18 milliards to France and 3
milliards to Belgium (on the assumption that the
United States also would forego the trifle due to
her). This sum should be discharged by an annual
payment of 6 per cent of the sum due (being
5 per cent interest and 1 per cent sinking fund)
over a period of thirty years. With the assistance
of minor measures to ease the opening period,
it is reasonable to suppose that this amount
could be paid without serious injury to any one.</p>

<p>In so far as it proves convenient to discharge
this liability in goods, and not in cash, so much
the better. But I see no advantage in laying
stress on this. It would be wiser to leave Germany
to find the money as best she can, any payment
in goods being by mutual agreement, as in
the Wiesbaden plan.</p>

<p>It may lead, however, to great anomalies to fix
the annual payments in terms of <i>gold</i> over so long
a period as thirty years. If gold prices fall, the
burden may become intolerable. If gold prices
rise, the claimants may be cheated of their expectations.
The annual payment should be adjusted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
therefore, by some impartial authority,
with reference to an index number of the commodity&ndash;value
of gold.</p>

<p>The other Treaty change relates to the Occupation.
It would promote peaceable relations in
Europe if, as a part of the new settlement, the
Allied troops were withdrawn altogether from
German territory, and all rights of invasion for
whatever purpose waived, except by leave of a
majority vote of the League of Nations. But in
return, the British Empire and the United States
should guarantee to France and Belgium all reasonable
assistance, short of warfare, in securing
satisfaction for their reduced claims; whilst Germany
should guarantee the complete de&ndash;militarization
of her territory west of the Rhine.</p>

<p class="p2 pn center">II. <i>The Satisfaction of the Allies</i></p>

<p class="pn p1"><i>France.</i>&mdash;Is it in the interest of France to accept
this settlement? If it is combined with further
concessions from Great Britain and the
United States by the cancelation of her debts to
them, it is overwhelmingly in her interest.</p>

<p>What is her present balance&ndash;sheet of claims and
liabilities? She is entitled to 52 per cent of what
Germany pays. On p. 75 I have calculated what
this will be under the London Settlement, (<i>a</i>) on
the basis of German exports at the rate of 6 milliards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
namely 3.56 milliard gold marks; and (<i>b</i>)
on the basis of exports at the rate of 10 milliards,
namely 4.60 milliard gold marks. Franceʼs share,
therefore, is 1.85 milliards per annum on assumption
(<i>a</i>), and 2.39 milliards on assumption (<i>b</i>).
On the other hand, she owes the United States
$3634 million and the United Kingdom £557 million.
If these sums be converted into gold marks
at par, and the annual charge on them is calculated
at 5 per cent for interest and 1 per cent
for sinking fund, her liability is 1.48 milliards
per annum. That is to say, if Germany pays in
full and if the more favorable assumption (<i>b</i>) is
adopted as to the growth of her exports, the most
for which France can hope under existing arrangements
is a net sum of .91 milliard gold marks
(£45,500,000 gold) per annum. Whereas under the
revised scheme she will not only be entitled to a
greater sum, namely 1.08 milliard gold marks
(£54,000,000 gold) per annum; but, inasmuch as
she will be accorded a priority on Germanyʼs available
resources, and as the total charge is within
Germanyʼs capacity, she may reasonably expect
to be paid.</p>

<p>My proposal provides for the complete restoration
of the devastated provinces at a fair valuation
of the actual damage done, and it abandons
other rival claims which stand in the way of the
priority of this paramount claim. But apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
from this, about which opinions will differ, and
apart from the increased likelihood which it affords
of really getting payment, France will actually
receive a larger sum than if the letter of
the existing agreements is adhered to all round.</p>

<p><i>Belgium</i> is entitled at present to 8 per cent of
the receipts, which under the London Settlement
would amount to 280 million gold marks per annum
on assumption (<i>a</i>) and 368 million on assumption
(<i>b</i>). Under the new proposal she will receive
180 million gold marks per annum and will
gain in certainty what she loses in possible receipts.
The satisfaction of her existing priority
should be adjusted by mutual agreement between
herself and France.</p>

<p><i>Italy</i> would gain immensely. She is entitled to
10 per cent of the receipts under the London Settlement
(together with some claims on problematical
receipts from Austria and Bulgaria);
that is to say, 326 million gold marks per annum
on assumption (<i>a</i>) and 460 million on assumption
(<i>b</i>). But these sums are far below the annual
charge of her obligations towards the United
Kingdom and the United States, which, converted
into gold marks on the same basis as that employed
above in the case of France, amounts to
1000 million gold marks per annum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 pn center">III. <i>The Assistance of New States</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">I have reserved above, out of the claims of
Great Britain, a sum of one milliard gold marks,
with the object, not that she should retain this
sum for herself, but that she should use it to ease
the financial problems of two states for which she
has a certain responsibility, namely Austria and
Poland.</p>

<p><i>Austriaʼs</i> problems are well known and attract
a general sympathy. The Viennese were not
made for tragedy; the world feels that, and there
is none so bitter as to wish ill to the city of Mozart.
Vienna has been the capital of degenerate greatness,
but, released from imperial temptations, she
is now free to fulfil her true rôle of providing
for a quarter&ndash;part of Europe the capital of commerce
and the arts. Somehow she has laughed
and cried her way through the last two years; and
now, I think, though on the surface her plight is
more desperate than before, a very little help will
be enough. She has no army, and by virtue of
the depreciation of her money a trifling internal
debt. Too much help may make of her a lifelong
beggar; but a little will raise her from despondency
and render her financial problem no
longer beyond solution.</p>

<p>My proposal, then, is to cancel the debts she
owes to foreign governments, including empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
claims to Reparation, and to give her a comparatively
small sum out of the milliard gold marks
reserved from British claims on Germany. Credits
placed at her disposal in Berlin, equivalent
in value to 300 million gold marks, to be available,
as required, over a period of five years, might be
enough.</p>

<p>For the other new States, the cancelation of
debt owing, and, in the case of Hungary, of Reparation
claims, should be enough, except for
Poland.</p>

<p><i>Poland</i>, too, must be given a possible problem,
but it is not easy to be practical with so impracticable
a subject. Her main problem can be
solved only by time, and the recovery of her
neighbors. I deal here only with the urgent question
of making just possible for her a reorganization
of currency, and of facilitating a peaceable
intercourse between herself and Germany.
For this purpose I would assign to her the balance
of the reserved milliard, namely, 700 million
gold marks, of which the annual interest should
be available to her unconditionally, but of which
the capital should be employed only for a currency
reorganization, under conditions to be
approved by the United States and Great Britain.</p>

<p>In its essentials this scheme is very simple. I
think that it satisfies my criterion of leaving every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Finance Minister in Europe with a possible problem.
The rest must come gradually, and I will
not burden the argument of this book by considering
along what lines the detailed solutions
should be sought.</p>

<p>Who are the losers? Even on paper&mdash;far more
in reality&mdash;every continental country gains an advantage.
But on paper the United States and the
United Kingdom are losers. What is each of
them giving up?</p>

<p>Under the London Settlement Great Britain is
entitled to 22 per cent of the receipts, which is
from 780 to 1010 million gold marks per annum
(£39,000,000 to £50,500,000 gold) according to
which assumption is adopted as to the volume of
German exports. She is owed by various European
governments (including Russia, see Appendix
No. IX.) £1,800,000,000, which at 6 per cent
for interest and sinking fund is £108,000,000 per
annum. On paper she would forego these sums,
say £150,000,000 per annum, altogether. In actual
fact, her prospects of securing more than a fraction
of this amount are remote. Great Britain
lives by commerce, and most Englishmen now
need but little persuading that she will gain more
in honor, prestige, and wealth by employing a
prudent generosity to preserve the equilibrium
of commerce and the well&ndash;being of Europe, than
by attempting to exact a hateful and crushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
tribute, whether from her victorious Allies or her
defeated enemy.</p>

<p>The United States would forego on paper a capital
sum of about 6500 million dollars, which, at
6 per cent, represents an annual charge of $390,000,000
(£78,000,000 gold). But in my opinion
the chance of her being actually paid any considerable
amount of this, if she tries to exact it, is
decidedly remote.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Is there any likelihood of the
United States joining in such a scheme <i>soon
enough</i> (for I feel confident she will cancel these
debts in the end) to be useful?</p>

<p>Most Americans, with whom I have discussed
this question, express themselves as personally favorable
to the cancelation of the European debts,
but add that so great a majority of their countrymen
think otherwise that such a proposal is at
present outside practical politics. They think,
therefore, that it is premature to discuss it; for
the present, America must pretend she is going
to demand the money and Europe must pretend
she is going to pay it. Indeed, the position is
much the same as that of German Reparation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
England in the middle of 1921. Doubtless my informants
are right about this public opinion, the
mysterious entity which is the same thing perhaps
as Rousseauʼs General Will. Yet, all the same,
I do not attach, to what they tell me, too much
importance. Public opinion held that Hans Andersenʼs
Emperor wore a fine suit; and in the
United States especially, public opinion changes
sometimes, as it were, <i>en bloc</i>.</p>

<p>If, indeed, public opinion were an unalterable
thing, it would be a waste of time to discuss public
affairs. And though it may be the chief business
of newsmen and politicians to ascertain its
momentary features, a writer ought to be concerned,
rather, with what public opinion should
be. I record these platitudes because many
Americans give their advice, as though it were
actually immoral to make suggestions which public
opinion does not now approve. In America, I
gather, an act of this kind is considered so reckless,
that some improper motive is at once suspected,
and criticism takes the form of an inquiry
into the culpritʼs personal character and antecedents.</p>

<p>Let us inquire, however, a little more deeply
into the sentiments and emotions which underlie
the American attitude to the European debts.
They want to be generous to Europe, both out of
good feeling and because many of them now suspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
that any other course would upset their own
economic equilibrium. But they donʼt want to
be “done.” They do not want it to be said that
once again the old cynics in Europe have been
one too many for them. Times, too, have been
bad and taxation oppressive; and many parts of
America do not feel rich enough at the moment to
favor a light abandonment of a possible asset.
Moreover, these arrangements, between nations
warring together, they liken much more closely
than we do to ordinary business transactions between
individuals. It is, they say, as though a
bank having made an unsecured advance to a
client, in whom they believe, at a difficult time
when he would have gone under without it, this
client were then to cry off paying. To permit
such a thing would be to do an injury to the elementary
principles of business honor.</p>

<p>The average American, I fancy, would like to
see the European nations approaching him with a
pathetic light in their eyes and the cash in their
hands, saying, “America, we owe to you our liberty
and our life; here we bring what we can in
grateful thanks, money not wrung by grievous
taxation from the widow and orphan, but saved,
the best fruits of victory, out of the abolition of
armaments, militarism, Empire, and internal
strife, made possible by the help you freely gave
us.” And then the average American would reply:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
“I honor you for your integrity. It is what
I expected. But I did not enter the war for profit
or to invest my money well. I have had my reward
in the words you have just uttered. The
loans are forgiven. Return to your homes and
use the resources I release to uplift the poor and
the unfortunate.” And it would be an essential
part of the little scene that his reply should come
as a complete and overwhelming surprise.</p>

<p>Alas for the wickedness of the world! It is not
in international affairs that we can secure the sentimental
satisfactions which we all love. For only
individuals are good, and all nations are dishonorable,
cruel, and designing. In deciding whether
Italy (for example) must pay what she owes,
America must consider the consequences of trying
to make her pay,&mdash;so far as self&ndash;interest is
concerned, in terms of economic equilibrium between
America and Italy, and, so far as generosity
is concerned, in terms of Italian peasants and
their lives. And whilst the various Prime Ministers
will telegraph something suitable, drafted
by their private secretaries, to the effect that
Americaʼs action makes the moment of writing
the most important in the history of the world
and proves that Americans are the noblest creatures
living, America must not expect adequate
or appropriate thanks.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, since time presses, we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
rely on American assistance, and we must do
without it if necessary. If America does not feel
ready to participate in a Conference of Revision
and Reconstruction, Great Britain should be prepared
to do her part in the cancelation of paper
claims, irrespective of similar action by the United
States.</p>

<p>The simplicity of my plan may be emphasized
by summarizing it. (1) Great Britain, and if
possible America too, to cancel all the debts owing
them from the Governments of Europe and to
waive their claims to any share of German Reparation;
(2) Germany to pay 1260 million gold
marks (£63,000,000 gold) per annum for 30
years, and to hold available a lump sum of 1000
million gold marks for assistance to Poland and
Austria; (3) this annual payment to be assigned
in the shares 1080 million gold marks to France
and 180 million to Belgium.</p>

<p>This would be a just, sensible, and permanent
settlement. If France were to refuse it, she
would indeed be sacrificing the substance to the
shadow. In spite of superficial appearances to
the contrary, it is also in the self&ndash;interest of Great
Britain. Perhaps British public opinion, profoundly
altered though it now is, may not yet be
reconciled to obtaining nothing. But this is a case
where a wise nation will do best by acting in a
large way. I have not neglected to consider with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
care the various possible devices by which Great
Britain might get, or appear to get, something
for herself from the settlement. She might take,
for instance, in satisfaction of her claims some of
the C Bonds under the London Settlement, which,
having a third priority after provision for the
A and B Bonds, can be given a nominal value but
are really worth nothing. She might, in lieu of
receiving a share of the proceeds of the German
customs, stipulate that her goods should be admitted
into Germany free of duty. She might
seek a partial control over German industries, or
obtain the services of German organization for the
future exploitation of Russia. Plans of this sort
attract an ingenious mind and are not to be discarded
too hastily. Yet I prefer the simple plan,
and I believe that all these devices are contrary
to true wisdom.</p>

<p>There is a disposition in some quarters to insist
that any concessions to France by Great Britain
and the United States, affecting Reparation and
Inter&ndash;Ally Debt, should be conditional on Franceʼs
acceptance of a more pacific policy towards the
rest of the world than that to which she herself
appears to be inclined. I hope that France will
abandon her opposition to proposals for reduced
military and naval establishments. What a
handicap her youth will suffer if she maintains
conscription whilst her neighbors, voluntarily or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
involuntarily, have abandoned it! Does she realize
the impossibility of friendship between Great
Britain and <i>any</i> neighboring Power which embarks
on a large program of submarines? I
hope, too, that France will forget her dangerous
ambitions in Central Europe and will limit strictly
those in the Near East; for both are based on
rubbishy foundations and will bring her no good.
That she has anything to fear from Germany in
the future which we can foresee, except what she
may herself provoke, is a delusion. When Germany
has recovered her strength and pride, as
in due time she will, many years must pass before
she again casts her eyes Westward. Germanyʼs
future now lies to the East, and in that direction
her hopes and ambitions, when they revive, will
certainly turn.</p>

<p>France has an opportunity now of consolidating
her national position into one of the stablest, safest,
richest on the face of the earth; self&ndash;contained;
well&ndash; but not over&ndash;populated; the heir of
a peculiar and splendid civilization. Neither
whining about devastated districts, which are easily
repaired, nor boasting of military hegemonies,
which can quickly ruin her, let her lift up her head
as the leader and mistress of Europe in the peaceful
practices of the mind.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these objects are not to be gained
by bargaining and cannot be imposed from without.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Therefore they must not be dragged into
the Reparation Settlement. This Settlement
must be offered France on one condition only,&mdash;that
she accepts it. But if, like Shylock, she
claims her pound of flesh, then let the Law prevail.
Let her have her bond, and let us have our
bonds too. Let her get what she can from Germany
and pay what she owes to the United States
and England.</p>

<p>The chief question for dispute is, perhaps,
whether an annual payment by Germany of £63,000,000
(gold) is enough. I admit that the payment
of a somewhat larger sum may prove to be
within her capacity. But I recommend this figure
because on the one hand it is sufficient to restore
the destruction done in France, yet on the
other is not so crushing that, to make Germany
pay it, we need be in a position to invade her
every spring and autumn. We must fix the payment
at an amount which Germany herself will
recognize as not unjust, and which is sufficiently
within her maximum capacity to leave her some
incentive to work and pay it off.</p>

<p>Suppose that we knew the theoretical maximum
of Germanyʼs capacity to produce and sell abroad
a surplus of goods, or could hit on some sliding
scale which would automatically absorb year by
year whatever surplus there was; should we be
wise to demand it? The project of extracting at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the point of the bayonet&mdash;for that is what it would
mean&mdash;a payment so heavy that it would never be
paid voluntarily, and to go on doing this until all
the makers of the Peace Treaty of Versailles
have been long dead and buried in their local
Valhallas, is neither good nor sensible.</p>

<p>My own proposals, moderate though they may
seem in comparison with others, throw on Germany
a very great burden. They procure for
France an enormous benefit. Frenchmen, having
fed to satiety on imaginary figures, are nearly
ready, I think, to find a surprising flavor and
piquancy in real ones. Let them consider what
a tremendous financial strength my scheme would
give them. Freed from external debt, they would
receive in real values each year for thirty years
a payment equivalent in gold to nearly half the
gold reserve now held by the Bank of France;
and at the end of the set period Germany would
have paid back ten times what she took after 1870.</p>

<p>Is it for Englishmen to complain? Are they
really losers? One cannot cast up a balance&ndash;sheet
between incommensurables. But peace and amity
might be won for Europe. And England is only
asked (as I fancy she knows pretty well, by now,
in her bones) to give up something which she will
never get anyhow. The alternative is that we and
the United States will be jockeyed out of our
claims amidst a general international disgust.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">(<i>B</i>) <i>The Allied Note to Germany on the Subject of Coal
Deliveries</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">1. The German Government undertakes to place at
the disposal of the Allies, from August 1, 1920, for the
ensuing six months, 2,000,000 tons of coal per month,
this figure having been approved by the Reparation Commission.</p>

<p>2. The Allied Governments will credit the Reparation
accounts with the value of this coal, as far as it is
delivered by rail or inland navigation, and it will be
valued at the German internal price in accordance with
Paragraph 6 (A), Annex V., Part VIII., of the Treaty
of Versailles. In addition, in consideration of the admission
of the right of the Allies to have coal of specified
kind and quality delivered to them, a premium of five
gold marks, payable in cash by the party taking delivery,
shall be applied to the acquisition of foodstuffs for the
German miners.</p>

<p>3. During the period of the coal deliveries provided
for above, the stipulations of Paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of
the draft Control Protocol of July 11, 1920, shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
put in force at once in the modified form of the Annex
hereto. (See below.)</p>

<p>4. An agreement shall be made forthwith between the
Allies for distribution of the Upper Silesian coal output
by a Commission on which Germany will be represented.
This agreement shall be submitted for the approval of
the Reparation Commission.</p>

<p>5. The Commission, on which the Germans shall be
represented, shall meet forthwith at Essen. Its purpose
shall be to seek means by which the conditions of life
among the miners with regard to food and clothing can
be improved, with a view to the better working of the
mines.</p>

<p>6. The Allied Governments declare their readiness
to make advances to Germany equal in amount to the
difference between the price paid under Paragraph 2
above, and the export price of German coal, f.o.b. in
German ports, or the English export price, f.o.b. in
English ports, whichever may be the lowest, as laid down
in Paragraph VI. (B) of Annex V., Part VIII., of the
Treaty of Versailles. These advances shall be made in
accordance with Articles 235 and 251 of the Treaty of
Versailles. They shall enjoy an absolute priority over
all other Allied claims on Germany. The advances shall
be made at the end of each month, in accordance with
the number of tons delivered and the average f.o.b. price
of coal during the period. Advances on account shall
be made by the Allies at the end of the first month,
without waiting for exact figures.</p>

<p>7. If by November 15, 1920, it is ascertained that the
total deliveries for August, September, and October 1920
have not reached 6,000,000 tons, the Allies will proceed
to the occupation of a further portion of German territory,
either the region of the Ruhr or some other.</p>

<p class="pn center p1"><i>Annex</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">1. A permanent delegation of the Reparation Commission
will be set up at Berlin, whose mission will be
to satisfy itself by the following means that the deliveries
of coal to the Allies provided for under the Agreement
of July 15, 1920, shall be carried out: The programmes
for the general distribution of output, with
details of origin and kind, on the one hand, and the
orders given to ensure deliveries to the Allied Powers
on the other hand, shall be drawn up by the responsible
German authorities and submitted by them for the approval
of the said delegation a reasonable time before
their despatch to the executive bodies responsible for
their execution.</p>

<p>2. No modification in the said programme which may
involve a reduction in the amount of the deliveries to
the Allies shall be put into effect without prior approval
of the Delegation of the Reparation Commission in
Berlin.</p>

<p>3. The Reparation Commission, to which the German
Government must periodically report the execution by
the competent bodies of the orders for deliveries to the
Allies, will notify to the interested Powers any infraction
of the principles adopted herein.</p>

<p>(2) Forty&ndash;two annuities, reckoning from May 1, 1921,
equivalent to 12 per cent of the value of Germanyʼs
exports, levied on the receipts from them and payable
in gold two months after the conclusion of each six&ndash;monthly
period.</p>

<p>To ensure that (2) above shall be completely carried
out, Germany will accord to the Reparation Commission
every facility for verifying the amount of the exports
and for establishing the necessary supervision.</p>

<p>2. The German Government shall deliver forthwith
to the Reparation Commission Bearer Bonds payable at
the due dates laid down in Article 1 (1) of the present
scheme, and of an amount equal to each of the six&ndash;monthly
instalments payable thereunder. Instructions
will be given with the object of facilitating, on the part
of such Powers as may require it, the mobilisation of
the portion accruing to them under the Agreements
which they have established amongst themselves.</p>

<p>3. Germany shall be entitled at any time to anticipate
the fixed portion of her obligation.</p>

<p>Payments made by her in anticipation shall be applied
in reduction of the fixed annuities prescribed in Article
1 (1), discounted at a rate of 8 per cent up to May 1,
1923, 6 per cent from May 1, 1923, to May 1, 1925, and
5 per cent after May 1, 1925.</p>

<p>4. Germany shall not embark on any credit operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
abroad, directly or indirectly, without the approval of
the Reparation Commission. This restriction applies to
the Government of the German Empire, the Government
of the German States, German provincial and municipal
authorities, and also to companies and enterprises controlled
by these Governments and authorities.</p>

<p>5. In pursuance of Article 248 of the Treaty of Versailles
all the assets and revenues of the German Empire
and its constituent States are held in guarantee of
the complete execution by Germany of the provisions of
this scheme.</p>

<p>The receipts of the German Customs, by land and
sea, in particular the receipts of all import and export
duties and all supplementary taxes, constitute a special
pledge for the execution of the present Agreement.</p>

<p>No modification shall be introduced, liable to diminish
the yield of the Customs, without the Reparation
Commission approving the Customs Legislation and
Regulations of Germany.</p>

<p>The whole of the receipts of the German Customs shall
be credited to the account of the German Government,
by a Receiver&ndash;General of the German Customs, nominated
by the German Government with the assent of
the Reparation Commission.</p>

<p>In the event of Germany failing to meet one of the
payments laid down in the present scheme:</p>

<p>(1) The whole or part of the receipts of the German
Customs shall be taken over from the Receiver&ndash;General
of the German Customs by the Reparation Commission
and applied by it to the obligations in which Germany
has defaulted. In this event the Reparation Commissions
shall, if it deems necessary, itself assume the administration
and collection of the Customs receipts.</p>

<p>(2) The Reparation Commission shall be entitled, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
addition, to require the German Government to impose
such higher tariffs or to take such other measures to
increase its resources as it may deem indispensable.</p>

<p>(3) If this injunction is without effect, the Commission
shall be entitled to declare the German Government
in default and to notify this state of affairs to the Governments
of the Allied and Associated Powers who shall
take such measures as they think justified.</p>

<p class="pn p2 center">IV. <span class="smcap">The First Ultimatum of London, March 3, 1921</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">The following declaration was delivered to Dr. Simons
by Mr. Lloyd George, speaking on behalf of the British
and Allied Governments, by word of mouth:</p>

<p>“The Allies have been conferring upon the whole
position and I am now authorised to make this declaration
on their behalf:</p>

<p>“The Treaty of Versailles was signed less than two
years ago. The German Government have already defaulted
in respect of some of its most important provisions:
the delivery for trial of the criminals, who have
offended against the laws of war, disarmament, the payment
in cash or in kind of 20,000,000,000 of gold marks
(£1,000,000,000). These are some of the provisions.
The Allies have displayed no harsh insistence upon the
letter of their bond. They have extended time, they
have even modified the character of their demands; but
each time the German Government failed them.</p>

<p>“In spite of the Treaty and of the honourable undertaking
given at Spa, the criminals have not yet been
tried, let alone punished, although the evidence has been
in the hands of the German Government for months.
Military organisations, some of them open, some clandestine,
have been allowed to spring up all over the country,
equipped with arms that ought to have been surrendered.
If the German Government had shown in
respect of reparations a sincere desire to help the Allies
to repair the terrible losses inflicted upon them by the
act of aggression of which the German Imperialist Government
was guilty, we should still have been ready as
before to make all allowances for the legitimate difficulties
of Germany. But the proposals put forward have
reluctantly convinced the Allies either that the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Government does not intend to carry out its Treaty
obligations, or that it has not the strength to insist, in
the face of selfish and short&ndash;sighted opposition, upon the
necessary sacrifices being made.</p>

<p>“If that is due to the fact that German opinion will
not permit it, that makes the situation still more serious,
and renders it all the more necessary that the
Allies should bring the leaders of public opinion once
more face to face with facts. The first essential fact
for them to realise is this&mdash;that the Allies, whilst prepared
to listen to every reasonable plea arising out of
Germanyʼs difficulties, cannot allow any further paltering
with the Treaty.</p>

<p class="pn center p1"><i>The Ultimatum</i></p>

<p class="pn p1">“We have therefore decided&mdash;having regard to the
infractions already committed, to the determination indicated
in these proposals that Germany means still
further to defy and explain away the Treaty, and to the
challenge issued not merely in these proposals but in
official statements made in Germany by the German
Government&mdash;that we must act upon the assumption that
the German Government are not merely in default, but
deliberately in default; and unless we hear by Monday
that Germany is either prepared to accept the Paris
decisions or to submit proposals which will in other
ways be an equally satisfactory discharge of her obligations
under the Treaty of Versailles (subject to the
concessions made in the Paris proposals), we shall, as
from that date, take the following course under the
Treaty of Versailles.</p>

<p>“The Allies are agreed:</p>

<p class="pn6 p1">(1) To occupy the towns of Duisburg, Ruhrort, and
Düsseldorf, on the right bank of the Rhine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn6 p1">(2) To obtain powers from their respective Parliaments
requiring their nationals to pay a certain
proportion of all payments due to Germany
on German goods to their several Governments,
such proportion to be retained on account
of reparations. (This is in respect of
goods purchased either in this country or in
any other Allied country from Germany.)</p>

<p class="pn6 p1">(3) (<i>a</i>) The amount of the duties collected by the
German Customs houses on the external frontiers
of the occupied territories to be paid to
the Reparation Commission.</p>

<p class="pn7">(<i>b</i>) These duties to continue to be levied in
accordance with the German tariff.</p>

<p class="pn7">(<i>c</i>) A line of Customs houses to be temporarily
established on the Rhine and at the
boundary of the <i>têtes des ponts</i> occupied by
the Allied troops; the tariff to be levied on this
line, both on the entry and export of goods, to
be determined by the Allied High Commission
of the Rhine territory in conformity with the
instructions of the Allied Governments”.</p>


<p class="pn6 p2"><span class="smcap">V. The German Counter&ndash;proposal, as Transmitted
to the United States Government, April 24, 1921</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">The United States Government have, by their Note of
April 22, opened the possibility, in a way which is thankfully
acknowledged, of solving the reparations problem
once more by negotiations ere a solution is effected by
coercive measures. The German Government appreciates
this step in its full importance. They have in the
following proposals endeavoured to offer that which according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
to their convictions represents the utmost limit
which Germanyʼs economic resources can bear, even with
the most favourable developments:</p>

<p>1. Germany expresses her readiness to acknowledge
for reparation purposes a total liability of 50 milliard
gold marks (present value). Germany is also prepared
to pay the equivalent of this sum in annuities, adapted
to her economic capacity up to an aggregate of 200 milliard
gold marks. Germany proposes to mobilise her
liability in the following way:</p>

<p>2. Germany to raise at once an international loan, of
which amount, rate of interest, and amortisation quota
are to be agreed on. Germany will participate in this
loan, and its terms, in order to secure the greatest possible
success, will contain special concessions, and generally
be made as favourable as possible. Proceeds of
this loan to be placed at the disposal of the Allies.</p>

<p>3. On the amount of her liability not covered by the
international loan Germany is prepared to pay interest
and amortisation quota in accordance with her economic
capacity. In present circumstances she considers the
rate of 4 per cent the highest possible.</p>

<p>4. Germany is prepared to let the Powers concerned
have the benefit of improvements in her economic and
financial situation. For this purpose the amortisation
quota should be made variable. In case an improvement
should take place, the quota would rise, whilst it
would correspondingly fall if developments should be
in the other direction. To regulate such variations an
index scheme would have to be prepared.</p>

<p>5. To accelerate the redemption of the balance, Germany
is ready to assist with all her resources in the
reconstruction of the devastated territories. She considers
reconstruction the most pressing part of reparation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
because it is the most effective way to combat the
hatred and misery caused by the war. She is prepared
to undertake, herself, the rebuilding of townships, villages,
and hamlets, or to assist in the reconstruction with
labour, material, and her other resources, in any way
the Allies may desire. The cost of such labour and material
she would pay herself. (Full details about this
matter have been communicated to the Reparation Commission.)</p>

<p>6. Apart from any reconstruction work Germany is
prepared to supply for the same purpose, to States concerned,
any other materials, and to render them any
other services as far as possible on a purely commercial
basis.</p>

<p>7. To prove the sincerity of her intention to make
reparation at once, and in an unmistakable way, Germany
is prepared to place immediately at the disposal
of the Reparation Commission the amount of one milliard
gold marks in the following manner: First, 150,000,000
gold marks in gold, silver, and foreign bills;
secondly, 850,000,000 gold marks in Treasury bills, to be
redeemed within a period not exceeding three months
by foreign bills and other foreign values.</p>

<p>8. Germany is further prepared, if the United States
and the Allies should so desire, to assume part of the
indebtedness of the Allies to the United States as far as
her economic capacity will allow her.</p>

<p>9. In respect of the method by which the German
expenditures for reparation purposes should be credited
against her total liability, Germany proposes that
prices and values should be fixed by a commission of
experts.</p>

<p>10. Germany is prepared to secure subscribers for the
loan in every possible way by assigning to them public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
properties or public income in a way to be arranged for.</p>

<p>11. By the acceptance of these proposals all other
German liabilities on reparation account are cancelled,
and German private property abroad released.</p>

<p>12. Germany considers that her proposals can only be
realised if the system of sanctions is done away with
at once; if the present basis of German production is
not further diminished; and if the German nation is
again admitted to the worldʼs commerce and freed of
all unproductive expenditure.</p>

<p>These proposals testify to the German firm will to
make good damage caused by the war up to the limit of
her economic capacity. The amounts offered, as well as
mode of payment, depend on this capacity. As far as
differences of opinion as to this capacity exist, the German
Government recommend that they be examined by
a commission of recognised experts acceptable to all the
interested Governments. She declares herself ready in
advance to accept as binding any decision come to by it.
Should the United States Government consider negotiations
could be facilitated by giving the proposals another
form, the German Government would be thankful
if their attention were drawn to points in which the
United States Government consider an alteration desirable.
The German Government would also readily receive
any other proposals the United States Government
might feel inclined to make.</p>

<p>The German Government is too firmly convinced that
the peace and welfare of the world depend on a prompt,
just, and fair solution of the reparation problem not to
do everything in their power to put the United States
in a position which enables them to bring the matter to
the attention of the Allied Governments.&mdash;<i>Berlin, April
24, 1921.</i></p>

<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">VI. The Assessment Announced by the Reparation
Commission, April 30, 1921</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">The Reparation Commission, in discharge of the provisions
of Article 233 of the Treaty of Versailles, has
reached a unanimous decision to fix at 132 milliard gold
marks the total of the damages for which reparation is
due by Germany under Article 232 (2) and Part VIII.,
Annex I. of the said Treaty.</p>

<p>In fixing this figure the Commission have made the
necessary deductions from the total of damages to cover
restitutions effected or to be effected in discharge of
Article 238, so that no credit will be due to Germany
from the fact of these restitutions.</p>

<p>The Commission have not included in the above figure
the sum corresponding to the obligation, which falls on
Germany as an addition in virtue of Article 232 (3),
“to make reimbursement of all sums which Belgium has
borrowed from the Allied and Associated Governments
up to November 11, 1918, together with interest at the
rate of 5 per cent per annum on such sums.”</p>


<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">VII. The Second Ultimatum of London, May 5, 1921</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">The Allied Powers, taking note of the fact that, in
spite of the successive concessions made by the Allies
since the signature of the Treaty of Versailles, and in
spite of the warnings and sanctions agreed upon at Spa
and at Paris, as well as of the sanctions announced in
London and since applied, the German Government is
still in default in the fulfilment of the obligations incumbent
upon it under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles
as regards (1) disarmament; (2) the payment
due on May 1, 1921, under Article 235 of the Treaty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
which the Reparation Commission has already called
upon it to make at this date; (3) the trial of the war
criminals as further provided for by the Allied Notes
of February 13 and May 7, 1920; and (4) certain other
important respects, notably those which arise under
Articles 264 to 267, 269, 273, 321, 322, and 327 of the
Treaty, decide:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn6 p1">(<i>a</i>) To proceed forthwith with such preliminary
measures as may be required for the occupation
of the Ruhr Valley by the Allied Forces on
the Rhine in the contingency provided for in
Paragraph (<i>d</i>) of this Note.</p>

<p class="pn6">(<i>b</i>) In accordance with Article 233 of the Treaty to
invite the Reparation Commission to prescribe
to the German Government without delay the
time and manner for securing and discharging
the entire obligation incumbent upon that Government,
and to announce their decision on
this point to the German Government at latest
on May 6.</p>

<p class="pn6">(<i>c</i>) To call upon the German Government categorically
to declare within a period of six days from
the receipt of the above decision its resolve (1)
to carry out without reserve or condition their
obligations as defined by the Reparation Commission;
(2) to accept without reserve or condition
the guarantees in respect of those obligations
prescribed by the Reparation Commission;
(3) to carry out without reserve or delay
the measures of military, naval, and aerial disarmament
notified to the German Government
by the Allied Powers in their Note of January

and the remainder by the prescribed dates;

232, and 233 of the Treaty of Versailles.</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">The Reparation Commission has, in accordance with
Article 233 of the Treaty of Versailles, fixed the time
and manner for securing and discharging the entire
obligation of Germany for Reparation under Articles
231, 232, and 233 of the Treaty as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>This determination is without prejudice to the duty
of Germany to make restitution under Article 238, or to
other obligations under the Treaty.</p>

<p>1. Germany will perform in the manner laid down in
this Schedule her obligations to pay the total fixed in
accordance with Articles 231, 232, and 233 of the Treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
of Versailles by the Commission&mdash;viz. 132 milliards of
gold marks (£6,600,000,000) less (<i>a</i>) the amount already
paid on account of Reparation; (<i>b</i>) sums which may
from time to time be credited to Germany in respect of
State properties in ceded territory, etc.; and (<i>c</i>) any
sums received from other enemy or ex&ndash;enemy Powers in
respect of which the Commission may decide that credits
should be given to Germany, <i>plus</i> the amount of the Belgian
debt to the Allies, the amounts of these deductions
and additions to be determined later by the Commission.</p>

<p>2. Germany shall create and deliver to the Commission
in substitution for bonds already delivered or deliverable
under Paragraph 12 (<i>c</i>) of Annex 2 of Part
VIII. (Reparation) of the Treaty of Versailles the bonds
hereinafter described.</p>

<p>(<i>A</i>) Bonds for an amount of 12 milliard gold marks
(£600,000,000). These bonds shall be created and delivered
at latest on July 1, 1921. There shall be an
annual payment from funds to be provided by Germany
as prescribed in this agreement, in each year from May 1,
1921, equal in amount to 6 per cent of the nominal value
of the issued bonds, out of which there shall be paid
interest at 5 per cent per annum, payable half&ndash;yearly on

and delivered at the latest on November 1, 1921. There
shall be an annual payment from funds to be provided
by Germany as prescribed in this agreement in each year
from November 1, 1921, equal in amount to 6 per cent
of the nominal value of the issued bonds, out of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
there shall be paid interest at 5 per cent per annum,
payable half&ndash;yearly on the bonds outstanding at any
time and the balance to sinking fund for the redemption
of the bonds by annual drawings at par. These bonds are
hereinafter referred to as bonds of Series (<i>B</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>C</i>) Bonds for 82 milliards of gold marks (£4,100,000,000),
subject to such subsequent adjustment by
creation or cancellation of bonds as may be required
under Paragraph (1). These bonds shall be created and
delivered to the Reparation Commission, without coupons
attached, at latest on November 1, 1921; they shall be
issued by the Commission as and when it is satisfied that
the payments which Germany undertakes to make in
pursuance of this agreement are sufficient to provide
for the payment of interest and sinking fund on such
bonds. There shall be an annual payment from funds to
be provided by Germany as prescribed in this agreement
in each year from the date of issue by the Reparation
Commission equal in amount to 6 per cent of the nominal
value of the issued bonds, out of which shall be paid
interest at 5 per cent per annum, payable half&ndash;yearly
on the bonds outstanding at any time, and the balance
to sinking fund for the redemption of the bonds by
annual drawings at par. The German Government shall
supply to the Commission coupons for such bonds as and
when issued by the Commission. These bonds are hereinafter
referred to as bonds of Series (<i>C</i>).</p>

<p>3. The bonds provided for in Article 2 shall be signed
German Government bearer bonds, in such form and in
such denominations as the Reparation Commission shall
prescribe for the purpose of making them marketable,
and shall be free of all German taxes and charges of
every description present or future.</p>

<p>Subject to the provisions of Articles 248 and 251 of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the Treaty of Versailles these bonds shall be secured on
the whole of the assets and revenues of the German Empire
and the German States, and in particular on the
specific assets and revenues specified in Article 7 of the
agreement. The service of the bonds of Series (<i>A</i>),
(<i>B</i>), and (<i>C</i>) shall be a first, second, and third charge
respectively on the said assets and revenues and shall be
met by the payments to be made by Germany under this
Schedule.</p>

<p>4. Germany shall pay in each year until the redemption
of the bonds provided for in Article 2 by means of
the sinking funds attached thereto&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn6 p1">(1) A sum of two milliard gold marks (£100,000,000).</p>

<p class="pn6">(2) (<i>a</i>) A sum equivalent to 25 per cent of the value
of her exports in each period of 12 months
starting from May 1, 1921, as determined by
the Commission; or</p>

<p class="pn8">(<i>b</i>) Alternatively an equivalent amount as fixed
in accordance with any other index proposed
by Germany and accepted by the Commission.</p>

<p class="pn6">(3) A further sum equivalent to 1 per cent of the
value of her exports as above defined, or alternatively
an equivalent amount fixed as provided
in (<i>b</i>) above.</p>

<p class="p1">Provided always that when Germany shall have discharged
all her obligations under this Schedule, other
than her liability in respect of outstanding bonds, the
amount to be paid in each year under this paragraph
shall be reduced to the amount required in that year to
meet the interest and sinking fund on the bonds then
outstanding.</p>

<p>Subject to the provisions of Article 5, the payments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
to be made in respect of Paragraph (1) above shall be
made quarterly before the end of each quarter, <i>i.e.</i> before
January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 each
year, and the payments in respect of Paragraphs (2)
and (3) above shall be made quarterly, November 15,
February 15, May 15, August 15, and calculated on the
basis of the exports in the last quarter but one preceding
that quarter, the first payment to be made November
15, 1921.</p>

<p>5. Germany will pay within 25 days from this notification
one milliard gold marks (£50,000,000) in gold or
approved foreign bills or in drafts at three months on
the German Treasury, endorsed by approved German
banks and payable in London, Paris, New York, or any
other place designated by the Reparation Commission.
These payments will be treated as the first two quarterly
instalments of the payments provided for in compliance
with Article 4 (1).</p>

<p>6. The Commission will within 25 days from this
notification, in accordance with Paragraph 12 (<i>d</i>), Annex
II. of the Treaty as amended, establish the special
Sub&ndash;Commission, to be called the Committee of Guarantees.
The Committee of Guarantees will consist of
representatives of the Allied Powers now represented on
the Reparation Commission, including a representative
of the United States of America, in the event of that
Government desiring to make the appointment.</p>

<p>The Committee shall co&ndash;opt not more than three
representatives of nationals of other Powers whenever it
shall appear to the Commission that a sufficient portion
of the bonds to be issued under this agreement is held
by nationals of such Powers to justify their representation
on the Committee of Guarantees.</p>

<p>7. The Committee of Guarantees is charged with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
duty of securing the application of Articles 241 and
248 of the Treaty of Versailles.</p>

<p>It shall supervise the application to the service of the
bonds provided for in Article 2 of the funds assigned
as security for the payments to be made by Germany
under Paragraph 4. The funds to be so assigned shall
be&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn6 p1">(<i>a</i>) The proceeds of all German maritime and land
customs and duties, and in particular the proceeds
of all import and export duties.</p>

<p class="pn6">(<i>b</i>) The proceeds of the levy of 25 per cent on the
value of all exports from Germany, except those
exports upon which a levy of not less than 25
per cent is applied under the legislation referred
to in Article 9.</p>

<p class="pn6">(<i>c</i>) The proceeds of such direct or indirect taxes or
any other funds as may be proposed by the
German Government and accepted by the Committee
of Guarantees in addition to or in substitution
for the funds specified in (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>)
above.</p>

<p class="p1">The assigned funds shall be paid to accounts to be
opened in the name of the Committee and supervised
by it, in gold or in foreign currency approved by the
Committee. The equivalent of the 25 per cent levy
referred to in Paragraph (<i>b</i>) shall be paid in German
currency by the German Government to the exporter.</p>

<p>The German Government shall notify to the Committee
of Guarantees any proposed action which may
tend to diminish the proceeds of any of the assigned
funds, and shall, if the Committee demand it, substitute
some other approved funds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>The Committee of Guarantees shall be charged further
with the duty of conducting on behalf of the Commission
the examination provided for in Paragraph
12 (<i>b</i>) of Annex 2 to Part VIII. of the Treaty of Versailles,
and of verifying on behalf of the said Commission,
and if necessary of correcting, the amount declared
by the German Government as the value of German
exports for the purpose of the calculation of the sum
payable in each year under Article 4 (2) and the
amounts of the funds assigned under this Article to the
service of the bonds. The Committee shall be entitled
to take such measures as it may deem necessary for the
proper discharge of its duties.</p>

<p>The Committee of Guarantees is not authorised to
interfere in German administration.</p>

<p>8. Germany shall on demand, subject to the prior
approval of the Commission, provide such material and
labour as any of the Allied Powers may require towards
the restoration of the devastated areas of that Power,
or to  enable any Allied Power to proceed with the
restoration or development of its industrial or economic
life. The value of such material and labour shall be
determined by a valuer appointed by Germany and a
valuer appointed by the Power concerned, and, in default
of agreement, by a referee nominated by the Commission.
This provision as to valuation does not apply
to deliveries under Annexes III., IV., V., and VI. to
Part VIII. of the Treaty.</p>

<p>9. Germany shall take every necessary measure of
legislative and administrative action to facilitate the
operation of the German Reparation (Recovery) Act,
1921, in force in the United Kingdom, and of any similar
legislation enacted by any Allied Power, so long as such
legislation remains in force. Payments effected by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
operation of such legislation shall be credited to Germany
on account of the payment to be made by her
under Article 4 (2). The equivalent in German currency
shall be paid by the German Government to the
exporter.</p>

<p>10. Payment for all services rendered, all deliveries in
kind, and all receipts under Article 9 shall be made to
the Reparation Commission by the Allied Power receiving
the same in cash or current coupons within one
month of the receipt thereof, and shall be credited to
Germany on account of the payments to be made by her
under Article 4.</p>

<p>11. The sum payable under Article 4 (3) and the
surplus receipts by the Commission under Article 4 (1)
and (2) in each year, not required for the payment of
interest and sinking fund on bonds outstanding in that
year, shall be accumulated and applied so far as they
will extend, at such times as the Commission may think
fit, by the Commission in paying simple interest not
exceeding 2½ per cent per annum from May 1, 1921,
to May 1, 1926, and thereafter at a rate not exceeding
5 per cent on the balance of the debt not covered by the
bonds then issued. No interest thereon shall be payable
otherwise.</p>

<p>12. The present Schedule does not modify the provisions
securing the execution of the Treaty of Versailles,
which are applicable to the stipulations of the present
Schedule.</p>


<p class="pn center p2"><span class="smcap">VIII. The Wiesbaden Agreement, October 6, 1921</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">This Agreement, signed by M. Loucheur and Herr
Rathenau at Wiesbaden on October 6, 1921, is a lengthy
document, consisting of a Protocol, Memorandum, and
Annex. The effective clauses are to be found mainly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the Annex. The full text has been published in a British
White Paper [Cmd. 1547]. This White Paper also contains
(1) an explanatory Memorandum, (2) the Decision
of the Reparation Commission, and (3) a Report
from Sir John Bradbury to the British Treasury. Extracts
from these three documents are given below.</p>


<p class="pn center p1">1. <i>Explanatory Memorandum</i></p>

<p class="pn">In order to understand the arrangements proposed by
the Wiesbaden Agreement, it is necessary to bear in
mind certain provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, the
application of which is affected by it.</p>

<p>The Treaty itself provides in the Reparation Chapter,
Part VIII., and in some of its Annexes, for the partial
liquidation of Germanyʼs reparation indebtedness
by deliveries in kind. The important passages in this
connection are Paragraph 19 of Annex II. and Annex
IV., which together make extensive provision for the delivery,
through the Reparation Commission, to the Allied
and Associated Powers of machinery, equipment,
tools, reconstruction material, and, in general, all such
material and labour as is necessary to enable any Allied
Power to proceed with the restoration or development of
its industrial or economic life.</p>

<p>Germanyʼs obligation being stated in terms of gold
and not in terms of commodities, provision has necessarily
been made in all cases for crediting Germany,
from time to time, with the fair value, as assessed by
the Reparation Commission, of such deliveries. Moreover,
since the proportions received by the respective
Powers in kind need not necessarily correspond exactly
with their respective shares in Germanyʼs reparation
payments, as determined by Inter&ndash;Allied agreement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
provision is further necessarily made in the Treaty to
render each Power accountable not only to Germany,
but to the Reparation Commission, for the value of
these deliveries. Thus, on the one hand, the Treaty
stipulates as between the Allies and Germany that the
value of services under the Annexes shall be credited
towards the liquidation of Germanyʼs general obligation,
and the Schedule of Payments assigns the value
of Annex deliveries to the service of the bonds handed
over by Germany as security for her debt. On the other
hand, the Treaty provides that for the purpose of equitable
distribution as between the Allies, the value of Annex
deliveries shall be reckoned in the same manner as
cash payments effected in the year, and the Schedule of
Payments stipulates that the value of the deliveries
received by each Power shall, within one month of the
date of delivery, be paid over to the Reparation Commission,
either in cash or in current coupons.</p>

<p>Further, the Treaty imposes upon the Reparation
Commission not only the duty of fixing prices, but also
of determining the capacity of Germany to deliver
goods demanded by any of the Allies, and, by implication,
of deciding between the competing demands which
are made upon that capacity by the Allies themselves.</p>

<p>The Wiesbaden Agreement provides for the delivery
by a German company<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> to French “sinistrés” of “all
plant and materials compatible with the productive capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
of Germany, her supply of raw materials and her
domestic requirements,” that is to say, of the articles
and materials which can be demanded under Annex IV.
and Paragraph 19 of Annex II., which are, by the terms
of the Agreement, in so far as France is concerned, virtually
suspended, the obligations of Germany to deliver
to France under the other Annexes remaining unaffected.</p>

<p>Any question as to the capacity of Germany to satisfy
the requirement of France, and all questions of price,
are to be settled by a Commission of three members,
one French and one German, and a third selected by
common agreement or nominated by the Swiss President.</p>

<p>The aggregate value of the deliveries to be made
under the Agreement, and of the deliveries to be made
under Annexes III., V. and VI. (hereafter, for the sake
of brevity, called the “Annex deliveries”) in the period
expiring on the 1st May 1926, is fixed at a maximum
of 7 milliard gold marks.</p>

<p>In regard to the Annex deliveries the Agreement in
no way modifies the Treaty provisions under which Germany
is credited and France debited forthwith with the
value, but special provisions, which are financially the
essential part of the Agreement, are made for bringing
to reparation account the value of the Agreement deliveries.
These special provisions are designed to secure
that Germany shall only be credited on reparation account
at the time of delivery with a certain proportion
of them, and that deliveries not thus accounted for,
which may be called “excess deliveries,” shall be liquidated
over a period of years beginning at the earliest on
1st May 1926. The provisions themselves are somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
intricate, comprising, as they do, a series of interacting
limitations, and they require some elucidation.</p>

<p class="pn6 p1">(1) In no case is credit to be given to Germany in
any one year for Annex and Agreement deliveries
together to an amount exceeding one
milliard gold marks.</p>

<p class="pn6">(2) In no case is credit to be given to Germany in
any one year for more than 45 per cent of the
value of the Agreement deliveries or for more
than 35 per cent if the value of the Agreement
deliveries exceeds one milliard gold marks.</p>

<p class="p1">The effect of the above is to prescribe that 55 per
cent (or, if the Agreement operates successfully, 65 per
cent) of the value of the Agreement deliveries <i>as a minimum</i>
will be the object of deferred payment by instalments.
If the Agreement deliveries reached really high
figures, the operation of the milliard limitation would
make the carry forward much more than 65 per cent.</p>

<p>The excess deliveries are to be liquidated with interest
at 5 per cent per annum in 10 equal annual instalments
as from 1st May 1926, subject to certain conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn6 p1">(1) France shall in no case be debited in one year
for Agreement deliveries with an amount which,
when added to the value of her Annex deliveries
in that year, would make her responsible for
more than her share (52 per cent) of the total
reparation payments made by Germany in that
year.</p>

<p class="pn6">(2) Agreement deliveries continue after 1st May
1926, with the same provisions for deferred
payment. If in any year between May 1926
and May 1936 the amount (not exceeding 35<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
or 45 per cent) of the value of that yearʼs
Agreement deliveries to be credited to Germany,
together with the annual instalment to
repay the debt incurred in respect of the period
ending 1st May 1926, exceeds one milliard, the
excess is to be carried forward from year to
year until a year is reached in which no such
excess is created by the payment. But in no
case shall the amount credited, even if it is less
than one milliard gold marks, exceed the limit
laid down by the preceding condition.</p>

<p class="pn6">(3) Any balance with which Germany has not been
credited on 1st May 1936 is to be credited to
her with compound interest at 5 per cent in
four half&ndash;yearly payments on 30th June and
31st December 1936 and 30th June and 31st
December 1937. But, again, these half&ndash;yearly
payments shall not be made if the effect of
making them would be to exceed the limit laid
down in Condition 1 above.</p>

<p class="pn6">(4) Agreement deliveries continue indefinitely after
1st May 1936, with power, however, to Germany
to arrest them whenever the execution of
them would result in France owing more than
52 per cent of Germanyʼs annual reparation
payment in respect of Annex deliveries, deferred
payments already matured, and the 35
or 45 per cent of current deliveries.</p>

<p class="p1">From the above it is to be noted that, while there is
a limitation for the first five years of the amount of
Agreement deliveries which can be demanded, there is&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn6 p1">(1) No point at which the right of France to demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
these special deliveries automatically terminates.</p>

<p class="pn6">(2) No final limitation upon the value of the deliveries
which can be demanded by France during
the lifetime of the Agreement.</p>

<p class="pn6">(3) No definitely prescribed period within which
Franceʼs debt to Germany and to the other
partners in reparation shall be liquidated.</p>

<p class="pn center">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</p>

<p class="pn p1">It remains necessary to draw attention to one subsidiary
point of a financial character under the Schedule
of Payments. Part of Germanyʼs annual reparation
liability consists of the payment of 26 per cent of the
value of German exports in each period of twelve
months, and part of the security for the payment consists
of the proceeds of a levy of 25 per cent on the value
of all German exports. The French Government has
undertaken to support a request, to be submitted by the
German Government to the Reparation Commission, for
the inclusion in the exports which form the basis of
these calculations of that part only of the value of the
deliveries made under the Agreement which is credited
to Germany and debited to France during any particular
year.</p>

<p>If it can be assumed that any part of the special deliveries
to be made under the Agreement would, in the
absence of the Agreement, have been diverted to Germanyʼs
ordinary external trade, then the concession
desired will have the effect of diminishing the annual
payments made by Germany for the benefit of the Allies
as a whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>


<p class="pn5 p1">2. <i>Decision of the Reparation Commission on October
20, 1921, after considering the Franco&ndash;German
Agreement of October 6, 1921</i></p>

<p class="pn">The French Government, having submitted to the
Reparation Commission in accordance with Paragraph 3
of the Memorandum thereto attached the Agreement between
the representatives of the French and German
Governments signed at Wiesbaden on the 6th instant, the
Commission has come to the following decision:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn6 p1">(1) It entirely approves the general principles underlying
the Agreement whereby special arrangements
are proposed for enabling Germany to
liquidate the largest possible proportion of her
reparation obligations in the form of goods and
services, more especially with a view to the
speedier restoration of the Devastated Regions.</p>

<p class="pn6">(2) At the same time, it considers that the Agreement
involves certain departures from the provisions
of Part VIII. of the Treaty of Versailles,
notably Article 237, Paragraphs 12 and 19 of
Annex II. and Paragraph 5 of Annex IV.</p>

<p class="pn6">(3) As the Commission has no power to authorise such
departures, it decides to refer the question to
the Governments represented on the Commission,
with a copy of the Memorandum and its
Annex, recommending a favourable examination
of them.</p>

<p class="pn6">(4) The Commission recommends that reasonable facilities
for deferred payment in respect of the
exceptional volume which, if the arrangements
are successful, the deliveries in kind to France
are likely to assume during the next few years,
should be accorded to France, subject to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
safeguards which the Allied Governments may
regard as necessary to protect their respective
interests.</p>

<p class="pn5 p1">3. <i>Concluding Recommendations of Sir John Bradburyʼs
Report to the British Government (October
26, 1921)</i></p>

<p class="pn">The safeguards which are envisaged as necessary by
my Italian and Belgian colleagues on the Reparation
Commission and myself, and for which we presume that
our respective Governments will desire to stipulate
are&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn6">(1) That a limit of time should be laid down after
the expiration of which no new deferment of
debit should be permitted and the liquidation
of the existing deferred debits should commence
to be made by regular annual instalments.</p>

<p class="pn">The precise length of this period should be determined
upon an estimate of the time necessary to carry out the
main work of reconstruction, regard being had to the
time required by Germany to effect the necessary supplies.
In view of the delays which are inevitable in
regard to operations of the magnitude of those contemplated,
the prescribed period might be reasonably somewhat
longer than the four and a half yearsʼ initial
period under the agreement, but it should not exceed
seven years.</p>

<p class="pn6">(2) That in no circumstances should the aggregate
amount for which debit against France for the
time being stands deferred be allowed to exceed
a prescribed amount, say, 4 milliard gold
marks.</p>

<p class="pn6">(3) That a provision should be inserted for the payment
by France to the general reparation account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
from time to time (within the limits of
the deferred debits for the time being outstanding)
of any amounts which may be necessary
to secure that the other Allies shall receive their
proper proportions of the amounts due from
Germany under the Schedule of Payments.</p>

<p class="p1">Subject to the introduction of these safeguards, to
which it would not appear that legitimate exception
could be taken, the arrangements contemplated by the
agreement may be expected to accelerate the solution of
the Reparation problem on practical lines in a manner
advantageous to France without prejudicing the interests
of other Powers, and it is upon this ground that
the Reparation Commission has unanimously recommended
them for favourable examination by the Allied
Governments.</p>

<p>If the Allied Governments approve the general
scheme, subject to whatever safeguards they may decide
to be necessary, there will remain certain subsidiary
points for the Reparation Commission to consider&mdash;amongst
other:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn6">(1) The proposed omission of the excess deliveries
from the index figure determining the annual
liability under the Schedule of Payments, until
such time as these deliveries are finally brought
to account for reparation purposes.</p>

<p class="pn6">(2) The special arrangements for substitution in respect
of articles of which France is entitled to
restitution by identity, involving in certain
cases money payments; and</p>

<p class="pn6">(3) The special arrangements in regard to the delivery
of coal and the prices to be credited and debited,
which in several particulars affect the
interest of other Powers.</p>

to be created to deal directly with the orders without the intervention
of the French and German Governments is intended to
obviate the delays which experience has shown to be inseparable
from the employment of the present machinery. It does not
appear to have any important bearing on the general financial
situation, since the deliveries will clearly have to be financed by
the German Government and will ultimately be paid for by means
of a reparation credit in account with the German Government.</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>THE NATION</i>, Dec. 13, 1919.&mdash;“This is the first heavy shot that
has been fired in the war which the intellectuals opened on the
statesmen the moment they realized what a piece of work the
Treaty was.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>WESTMINSTER GAZETTE</i>, Dec. 20, 1919.&mdash;“Mr. Keynes has
produced a smashing and unanswerable indictment of the economic
settlement.... It is too much to hope that the arbiters of our
destinies will read it and perhaps learn wisdom, but it should do
much good in informing a wide section of that public which will
in its turn become the arbiters of theirs.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>SUNDAY CHRONICLE</i>, Dec. 21, 1919.&mdash;“No criticism of the
Peace which omits, as Mr. Keynes seems to me by implication to
omit, the aspect of it not as a treaty, but as a sentence, has any
right to be heard by the European Allied peoples.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>THE SPECTATOR</i>, Dec. 20, 1919.&mdash;“The world is not governed
by economical forces alone, and we do not blame the statesmen at
Paris for declining to be guided by Mr. Keynes if he gave them
such political advice as he sets forth in his book.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>THE TIMES</i>, Jan. 5, 1920.&mdash;“Mr. Keynes has written an extremely
‘clever’ book on the Peace Conference and its economic consequences....
As a whole, his cry against the Peace seems to us
the cry of an academic mind, accustomed to deal with the abstractions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
of that largely metaphysical exercise known as ‘political
economy,’ in revolt against the facts and forces of actual political
existence.... Indeed, one of the most striking features of Mr.
Keynesʼs book is the political inexperience, not to say ingenuousness,
which it reveals.... He believes it would have been wise
and just to demand from Germany payment of £2,000,000,000 ‘in
final settlement of all claims without further examination of particulars.’”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>THE ATHENÆUM</i>, Jan. 23, 1920.&mdash;“This book is a perfectly
well&ndash;equipped arsenal of facts and arguments, to which every one
will resort for years to come who wishes to strike a blow against
the forces of prejudice, delusion, and stupidity. It is not easy to
make large numbers of men reasonable by a book, yet there are no
limits to which, without undue extravagance, we may not hope
that the influence of this book may not extend. Never was the
case for reasonableness more powerfully put. It is enforced with
extraordinary art. What might easily have been a difficult treatise,
semi&ndash;official or academic, proves to be as fascinating as a
good novel.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>FORTNIGHTLY REVIEW</i>, March 1, 1920.&mdash;“Mr. Keynesʼs book
has now been published three months, and no sort of official reply
to it has been issued. Nothing but the angry cries of bureaucrats
have been heard. No such crushing indictment of a great act of
international policy, no such revelation of the futility of diplomats
has even been made.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT</i>, April 29, 1920.&mdash;“Mr.
Keynes ... has violently attacked the whole work of those who
made the Treaty in a book which exhibits every kind of ability
except the political kind.... Mr. Keynes knows everything except
the elements of politics, which is the science of discovering,
and the art of accomplishing, the practicable in public affairs.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>TIMES</i> (“Annual Financial and Commercial Review”), Jan. 28,
1921.&mdash;“The almost unhealthy greed with which Mr. Keynesʼs
book on <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i> was devoured in
a dozen countries was but a symptom of the new desire to appreciate,
and, if possible, to cope with, the economic consequences not
only of the peace but of the war.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>LIVERPOOL COURIER</i>, Feb. 2, 1921.&mdash;“In the eyes of the
world&mdash;at least, of the world that is not pro&ndash;German&mdash;the reparation
costs are wholly inadequate. It is true that in the eyes of
Mr. J. M. Keynes it is wicked to charge Germany with the cost of
war pensions, but we imagine that the average man with a simple
sense of simple justice does not agree with Mr. Keynes.”</p>

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">Realist</span>” in the <i>ENGLISH REVIEW</i>, March 1921.&mdash;“The
operation of indemnity&ndash;payment must be followed through to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
remorseless end.... The cry ‘Germany must pay’ has still a good
healthy sound about it.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>ENGLISH REVIEW</i>, June 1921.&mdash;“What Mr. Maynard Keynes
predicted in his remarkable book is coming only too true. All over
Europe the nations are standing to arms, thinking boundaries,
while trade languishes, production stagnates, and credit lapses
into the relativities.”</p>

<p class="pn p2"><i>American</i></p>

<div class="lreduct">

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Joseph P. Cotton</span> in the <i>EVENING POST</i>, New York, Jan. 30,
1920.&mdash;“Mr. Keynesʼs book is the first good book on peace and the
reconstruction of Europe. The writing is simple and sincere and
true ... a great book with a real message.”</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Paul D. Cravath</span> in the <i>SUN AND NEW YORK HERALD</i>,
Feb. 2, 1920.&mdash;“No English novel during or since the war has had
such a success as this book. It should be read by every thoughtful
American. It is the first serious discussion of the Peace Treaty
by a man who knows the facts and is capable of discussing them
with intelligence and authority.”</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Harold J. Laski</span> in the <i>NATION</i>, New York, Feb. 7, 1920.&mdash;“This
is a very great book. If any answer can be made to the
overwhelming indictment of the Treaty that it contains, that answer
has yet to be published. Mr. Keynes writes with a fullness
of knowledge, an incisiveness of judgment, and a penetration into
the ultimate causes of economic events that perhaps only half&ndash;a-dozen
living economists might hope to rival. Nor is the manner
of his book less remarkable than its substance. The style is like
finely-hammered steel. It is full of unforgettable phrases and of
vivid portraits etched in the biting acid of a passionate moral
indignation.”</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">F. W. Taussig</span>, Harvard University, in the <i>QUARTERLY
JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS</i>, Feb. 1920.&mdash;“Mr. Keynes needs no
introduction to economists. The high quality of his work is
known. This book shows the sure touch, the wide interests, the
independent judgment, which we expect. It shows, also, fine spirit
and literary skill.... Coming to the economic provisions of the
Treaty, I find myself in general accord with what Mr. Keynes says.
He makes out an estimate of what Germany can do in the way of
reparation.... The maximum cannot, in his judgment, exceed
ten billions of dollars. Some such figure, it is not improper to say,
was reached independently by Professor A. A. Young in his estimates
for the American financial advisers.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>FINANCIAL WORLD</i>, New York City, Feb. 16, 1920.&mdash;“There is
a thousand dollars of information in it for the average business
man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>.”</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Frank A. Vanderlip</span> in <i>CHICAGO NEWS</i>, March 3, 1920.&mdash;“I
regard it as the most important volume published since the Armistice.
It is certain to have a profound effect on world thought. It
is a deep analysis of the economic structure of Europe at the outbreak
of the war, a brilliant characterisation of the Peace Conference,
a revealing analysis of the shortcomings of the Treaty, a dissection
of the reparation claims, done with the scientific spirit and
steadiness of hand of a great surgeon, a vision of Europe after the
Treaty, which is the most illuminating picture that has yet been
made of the immediate situation on the Continent, and, finally,
constructive remedial proposals. Every chapter bears the imprint
of a master hand, of a mind trained to translate economic data,
and of absolutely unfaltering courage to tell the truth.”</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Alvin Johnson</span> in the <i>NEW REPUBLIC</i>, April 14, 1920.&mdash;“There
has been no failure anywhere to recognise that Keynesʼs
<i>Economic Consequences of the Peace</i> requires an ‘answer.’ Too
many complacencies have been assailed by it.... What progress
are his critics making in their attack on it?... There is surprisingly
little effort made by American reviewers to refute the
charge that the Treaty is in many respects in direct violation of
the preliminary engagements, nor is anywhere a serious attempt
made to show that those engagements were not morally binding....
The critics have not seriously shaken Keynesʼs characterization
of the Treaty. They have not been able to get far away from
agreement with him as to what the Treaty should have been.
They admit the desirability of revision.”</p>

<p class="p1"><i>DETROIT FREE PRESS</i>, Nov. 21, 1921.&mdash;“Only once have I
seen Viviani go into action gradually. It was after his last trip
to the United States. He was talking in a subdued conversational
tone when suddenly he thought of John Maynard Keynesʼs book,
<i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i>. His face, hitherto motionless,
twitched a little. His words accelerated slowly. The
current of his emotion spread curiously through the muscles of
his whole body, until the figure which had been relaxed from head
to foot became tense in every fibre. In a moment he was denouncing,
with the sonorous blast of his anger, the book which he
said he had encountered in every country in the New World, as
‘a monument of iniquity,’ a monster which confronted him everywhere
in South or North America, and which for some (to him)
incredible reason everyone seemed to believe as the gospel truth
about the pact of Versailles.”</p>
